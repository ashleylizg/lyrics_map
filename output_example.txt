I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now
Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now
Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Dear Lord, when I get to heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds
Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?Look at you, kids, with your vintage music
Comin' through satellites while cruisin'
You're part of the past, but now you're the future
Signals crossing can get confusin'
It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes it's enough just to make you feel crazy
You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah
Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it
Seen so much, you could get the blues, but
That don't mean that you should abuse it
Though it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
I know, it's enough just to make you go crazy, crazy, crazy
But you get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
It don't matter because it's enough
To be young and in love, ah, ah
To be young and in love, ah, ah

And it's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
It's enough just to make me go crazy, crazy, crazy
I get ready, I get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
It doesn't matter if I'm not enough
For the future or the things to come
'Cause I'm young and in love, ah, ah
I'm young and in love, ah, ah, ah, ah

Don't worry, babyKiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
One, two, three, four
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you're the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
Oh, my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
One, two, three, four

In these stolen moments
The world is mine 
There's nobody here, just us together 
Keepin' me hot like July forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come late
'Cause boy, we're gold; boy, we're gold
And I was like…
Take off, take off

Then, we dance on the H of the Hollywood sign, yeah
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die 
My boyfriend's back
And he's cooler than ever 
There's no more night, blue skies forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control

It's hard for me to look into your eyes
When I say  that I would be nothing without your love 
I feel the rush and it's amazing
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place , yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all 
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way 
'Cause I know , all I know , all I know 
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo
I think I've been in Hollywood for too long 
'Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch 
I feel the rush and it's amazing, hmm
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all 
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way 
'Cause I know , all I know , all I know 
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo 
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold 
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo
I don't know
I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
And real life is stranger than my dreamsWhy? 
Who, me? 
Why? 
Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey 
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh – Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
Lost, but now I am found
I can see that once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers I need
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh – Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh – Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I, we were born to die

Boy, look at you, lookin' at me
I know you know how I feel
Lovin' you is hard, bein' here's harder
You take the wheel
I don't wanna do this anymore
It's so surreal
I can't survive
If this is all that's real
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye bye
Boy, look at you, lookin' at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We won't survive
We're sinkin' into the sand
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high

Anyone can start again
Not through love, but through revenge
Through the fire, we're born again
Peace by vengeance, brings the endSwinging in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name
Open up a beer and you say, "Get over here"
And play a video game
I'm in his favorite sundress, watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say, "You da bestest," lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
"Go play your video game"
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now you do
Singing in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do
I heard that you like the bad girls

And baby, now you do
Now you doLove , I said real love is like feelin' no fear
When you're standin' in the face of danger
'Cause you just want it so much
A touch from your real love
Is like heaven takin' the place of somethin' evil
And lettin' it burn off from the rush, yeah, yeah
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined
Love, is it real love?
It's like smilin' when the firin' squad's against you
And you just stay lined up, yeah
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
I fall to pieces when I'm with you, I fall to pieces 
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined 
My rose garden dreams, set on fire by fiends
And all my black beaches are ruined
My celluloid scenes are torn at the seams
And I fall to pieces 
I fall to pieces when I'm with you
'Cause I love you so much, I fall to pieces
My cherries and wine, rosemary and thyme
And all of my peaches are ruined 
Are ruined , are ruined Down on the West coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah, you
You're falling hard, I push away, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my love
I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love

Down on the West coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and Rock 'n' Roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher

Don't call me angel 
Don't call me angelI was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi, Dad"
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
24/7 Sylvia Plath
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
But I have it
Yeah, I have it
Yeah, I have it
I haveYou took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am
And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man 
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
I'm your man
I'm your man
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?He used to call me DN
That stood for Deadly Nightshade
'Cause I was filled with poison
But blessed with beauty and rage
Jim told me that, he hit me and it felt like a kiss
Jim brought me back, reminded me of when we were kids
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence
He used to call me poison
Like I was Poison Ivy
I could have died right there
'Cause he was right beside me
Jim raised me up, he hurt me but it felt like true love
Jim taught me that, loving him was never enough
With his ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
Ultraviolence
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolence
We could go back to New York
Loving you was really hard
We could go back to Woodstock
Where they don't know who we are
Heaven is on Earth
I would do anything for you, baby
Blessed is this union
Crying tears of gold like lemonade
I love you the first time, I love you the last time
Yo soy la princesa, comprende mis white lines
'Cause I'm your jazz singer and you're my cult leader
I love you forever, I love you forever
With his ultraviolence 
Ultraviolence 
Ultraviolence 
Ultraviolence 
I can hear sirens, sirens
He hit me and it felt like a kiss
I can hear violins, violins
Give me all of that ultraviolenceIt's never too late
To be who you wanna be
To say what you wanna say
Tattoo on my face, swimmin' in my safe
Tattoo on my face, swimmin' in my safe
It's never too late
To leave if you wanna leave 
Or to stay if you wanna stay
But, baby 
I got a feelin' in my bones
Tattoo on my face, swimmin' in my safe
Can't get you out of my veins 
You can't escape my affection 
Wrap you up in my daisy chains 
Hip-hop in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm 
Uh, her sophistication makes you wanna quit the bitch you datin'
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playin'
Boo, let's get acquainted 
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation 
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it 
But bang it like my fingers 
She pray to God I made it 
But bankin' like my Franklins 
My neighbors stopped the hatin' 
What? 
Huh? 
Slide inside it 
Diddy Boppin'  
Milly Rockin' 
She just might become my lover for real 
I might fuck with her all summer for real 
They better not holla if I cuff her for real 
Niggas better run for cover for real
Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real 
Truthfully, between you and me, I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out
Hip-hop in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm 
White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like makin' me crazy
Tell me, "have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In makin' me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lights and black beaches
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Don't be a bummer 
Don't be a bummer 
Hip-hop in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, hmm
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe 
Don't be a bummer, babe
Ooh ohh, ooh ohh
Ooh ohh, ooh ohhMy old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart
Swimming pool, glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal
Oh yeah
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins
Gimme them coins
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you
My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont, slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me
Gimme them coins
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it
My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said, "Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man"
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down and now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
You are my one true loveDarling, darling
Doesn't have a problem lying to herself
'Cause her liquor's top shelf
It's alarming, honestly, how charming she can be
Fooling everyone, telling Hum she's having fun
She says, "You don't want to be like me
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen"
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Famous and dumb at an early age"
Lying, I'm lying
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, woah
White lightning
Carmen, Carmen
Staying up till morning
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean
It's alarming, truly, how disarming you can be
Eating soft ice cream
Coney Island queen
She says, "You don't want to be like me
Looking for fun, getting high for free"
I'm dying, I'm dying
She says, "You don't want to get this way
Street walk at night, and a star by day"
It's tiring, tiring
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, woah
White lightning
Baby's all dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the little story of the girl you know
Relying on the kindness of strangers
Tying cherry knots
Smiling, doing party favours
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on
Sing your song, song, now the camera's on
And you're alive again
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi
Tu as besoin de moi, tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi
Et je mourrais sans toi
Je tuerais pour toi
The boys, the girls
They all like Carmen
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes
She laughs like God
Her mind's like a diamond
Audiotune lies
She's still shining
Like lightning, woah
White lightning
Like lightning, woah
White lightning
Darling, darling
Doesn't have a problem lying to herself
Cause her liquor's top shelfGoddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said "I love you"
You're fun and you’re wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah
'Cause you're just a man
It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Blue, blue, blue
Goddamn, man-child
You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two
Self-loathing poet, resident Laurel Canyon know-it-all
You talk to the walls when the party gets bored of you
But I don't get bored, I just see it through
Why wait for the best when I could have you? You?
'Cause you’re just a man
It’s just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through

Live stream, I'm sweet for you
Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
You're in the yard, I light the fire
And as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You write, I tour, we make it work
You're beautiful and I'm insane
We're American-made
Give me Hallmark
One dream, one life, one lover
Paint me happy in blue
Norman Rockwell
No hype under our covers

You heard my baby's back in town now
You should come, come over
We'll be hanging around now
You should come, come over
Oh God, I love him on my lips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
Touch me with your fingertips
It's me, your little Venice bitch
Back, back in the garden

Jealous of your love
If you weren't mine, I'd be
Jealous of your loveIn the car, in the car, in the backseat, I'm your baby
We go fast, we go so fast, we don’t move
I believe in a place you take me
Make you real proud of your baby
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin’ through you
In your car, I'm a star and I'm burnin' through you
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I'm a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I’m here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I’d just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
Dream a dream, here's a scene
Touch me anywhere ’cause I'm your baby
Grab my waist, don't waste any part
I believe that you see me for who I am
So spill my clothes on the floor of your new car
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
Is it safe, is it safe to just be who we are?
Oh, be my once in a lifetime
Lyin' on your chest in my party dress
I’m a fuckin' mess, but I
Oh, thanks for the high life
Baby, it's the best, passed the test and yes
Now I'm here with you, and I
Would like to think that you would stick around
You know that I'd just die to make you proud
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love song
The taste, the touch, the way we love
It all comes down to make the sound of our love songMoney is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?
I'm your national anthem, God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em, reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?", he said, "Yes, yes, yes…"
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
Kiss, kiss
I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
It's a love story for the new age, for the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up, give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of successBlue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
You fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean  and love hurts 
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time
Big dreams, gangsta
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, "No, please, stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work"
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating and pacing
But he was chasing  paper 
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time
You went out every night, and baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh baby, ooh, I will love you 'til the end of timeTa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Ta-da-da-da-da-da-da
They say I'm too young to love you
I don't know what I need
They think I don't understand
The freedom land of the seventies
I think I'm too cool to know ya
You say I'm like the ice I freeze
I'm churning out novels like
Beat poetry on Amphetamines
I say
I say
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby
They say I'm too young to love you
They say I'm too dumb to sing
They judge me like a picture book
By the colors, like they forgot to read
I think we're like fire and water
I think we're like the wind and sea
You're burning up, I'm cooling down
You're up, I'm down
You're blind, I see
But I'm free
I'm free
Well, my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get down to Beat poetry
And my jazz collection's rare
I can play most anything
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm talking about my generation
Talking about that newer nation
And if you don't like it
You can beat it
Beat it, baby
You never liked the way I said it
If you don't get it, then forget it
'Cause I don't have to fucking explain it
And my boyfriend's in a band
He plays guitar while I sing Lou Reed
I've got feathers in my hair
I get high on hydroponic weed
And my jazz collection's rare
I get down to Beat poetry
I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby
Pa-da-pa-pa, pa-de-da
Te-de-de, da-da-ah
Ooh, oh
Woah-ah
Yeah, my boyfriend's pretty cool
But he's not as cool as me
'Cause I'm a Brooklyn baby
I'm a Brooklyn baby
Pa-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, baby
Ah-ta-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da, baby
Pa-da-da-da-da-da
Pa-pa-da-pa-da, yeah
Yeah, yeahI was in the winter of my life
And the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me
And my only real happy times
I was a singer
Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky
That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didn’t really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is
When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing how I had been living, they asked me why, but there’s no use in talking to people who have a home
They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people
For home to be wherever you lie your head
I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul
No moral compass pointing due north
No fixed personality
Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn’t plan for it to turn out this way I’d be lying
Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one
Who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing
Who wanted everything
With a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn’t even talk about it
And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me
Every night I used to pray that I’d find my people
And finally I did
On the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore
Except to make our lives into a work of art
Live fast
Die young
Be wild
And have fun
I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever
"I believe in the kindness of strangers"
And when I'm at war with myself
I ride
I just ride
Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?
I have
I am fucking crazy
But I am freeI've been out on that open road
You can be my full-time daddy, white and gold
Singing blues has been getting old
You can be my full-time baby, hot or cold
Don't break me down 
I've been traveling too long 
I've been trying too hard 
With one pretty song 
I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride
Dying young and playing hard
That's the way my father made his life an art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it
Light 'til dark
Don't leave me now 
Don't say goodbye 
Don't turn around 
Leave me high and dry 
I hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just ride
I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes
All I've got to keep myself sane, baby
So I just ride, I just ride
Hear the birds on the summer breeze
I drive fast, I am alone at midnight
Been trying hard not to get into trouble
But I, I've got a war in my mind
I just ride, just ride
I just ride, I just rideSummertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home, there's none left for me
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
Oh, take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will, some day, rise
So, what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said, I'm gonna play with myself
Show them how we come off the shelf
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
Evil, we've come to tell you that she's evil, most definitely
Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension, it's getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harderI like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like
"Maybe  I'll do it differently"
So I moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly
Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it‚ I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do
I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you
You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby‚ wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly
Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do
It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, wind through my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
It's killing me slowly
Fuck it, I love you 
Fuck it, I love you 
Fuck it, I love you 
I really do 
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
Chances in my veins, running out of time
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
Chances in my veins, running out of time
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
Chances in my veins, running out of time
California dreamin', got my money on my mind
Chances in my veins, running out of timeFinally
I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
Undoubtedly
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts
This is my commitment
My modern manifesto
I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For… and for… 
And all my birds of paradise 
Who never got to fly at night 
'Cause they were caught up in the dance
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black 
Into the blue 
Finally
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
Was not discernin'
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind
There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them 
There's nothing to hold on to 
The colors used to lure you in 
And put you in a trance 
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
I wanna move
Out of the black 
Into the blue 
Out of the black 
Into the blue 
Out of the black 
Into the blue Do you want me or do you not?
I heard one thing, now I'm hearing another
Dropped a pin to my parking spot
The bar was hot, it's 2 AM, it feels like summer
Happiness is a butterfly
Try to catch it, like, every night
It escapes from my hands into moonlight
Every day is a lullaby
Hum it on the phone, like, every night
Sing it for my babies on the tour life, ah
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you
Baby, I just wanna dance 
With you 
Baby, I just wanna dance 
With you
Left the canyon, drove to the club
I was one thing, now I'm being another
Laurel down to Sunset in the truck
I'll pick you up if you're in town on the corner, ah
Happiness is a butterfly
We should catch it while dancing
I lose myself in the music, baby
Every day is a lullaby
Try to catch it like lightning
I sing it into my music, I'm crazy
If he's a serial killer, then what's the worst
That can happen to a girl who's already hurt?
I'm already hurt
If he's as bad as they say, then I guess I'm cursed
Looking into his eyes, I think he's already hurt
He's already hurt
I said, "Don't be a jerk, don't call me a taxi"
Sitting in your sweatshirt, crying in the backseat, ooh
I just wanna dance with you
Hollywood and Vine, Black Rabbit in the alley
I just wanna hold you tight down the avenue
I just wanna dance with you
I just wanna dance with you
Baby, I just wanna dance 
With you 
Baby, I just wanna dance 
With youI don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With drippin' peaches, I'm camera ready
Almost all the time
But I still get lonely
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind?
Across the county line
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' 
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine
But you still can find me, if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines
With the daisies, feelin' hazy
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lyin' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dyin' 
For somethin' real
That I've been dyin' for somethin' real
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying' if I kept hidin'
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't dealMy pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I got sweet taste for men who are older
It's always been so, it's no surprise
Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh yeah
I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows
Ah, he's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Drugs, suck it up, like vanilla icies
Don't treat me rough, treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck, diamantes ices
Why, come on, come on
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Come on, come on, come on, baby
Oh, oh
Ooh, ahh
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, oh yeahI miss Long Beach and I miss you, babe
I miss dancing with you the most of all
I miss the bar where the Beach Boys would go
Dennis' last stop before Kokomo
Those nights were on fire
We couldn't get higher
We didn't know that we had it all
But nobody warns you before the fall
And I'm wasted
Don't leave‚ I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess I'm signing off after all
I miss New York and I miss the music
Me and my friends‚ we miss rock 'n' roll
I want shit to feel just like it used to
When‚ baby, I was doing nothin' the most of all
The culture is lit, and if this is it‚ I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all
I'm wasted
Don't leave, I just need a wake-up call
I'm facing the greatest
The greatest loss of them all
The culture is lit and I had a ball
I guess that I'm burned out after all
If this is it, I'm signing off
Miss doing nothin' the most of all
Hawaii just missed that fireball
L.A. is in flames‚ it's getting hot
Kanye West is blond and gone
"Life on Mars" ain't just a song
I hope the live stream's almost onTopanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumblin' from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life can sometimes make it hard to dream
Life rocked me like Mötley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me ultra softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
How it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I hoped that you'd come back again
And tell me everything's okay, ay, babe, yeah
Topanga's hot today, Manson's in the air
And all my friends have gone, 'cause they still feel him here
I want to leave, I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothin's clear
Life rocked me like Mötley
Bad beginnin' to my new year
Life rocked me ultra softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about heroin
And how it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's okay, ay, babe, yeah
 Winter in the city
Somethin' 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
 Even for February
Somethin' 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writin' in blood on my walls and shit
Like, ah, oh my God
Jumpin' off from the walls into the docks and shit
Oh, ho ho ho, I'd be lyin' if I said I wasn't sick of it
Baby , come on , come on 
I'm flyin' to the moon again, dreamin' about marzipan
Taking all my medicine to take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane, leavin' my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I really changed, baby
 Somethin' 'bout the city
Don't know what it is, it makes my head get crazy
Oh, makes me feel like I can change
Oh, ho ho ho, all of my evil ways and shit
Oh, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of itCinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, on fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever didL.A., L.A.​
L.A., L.A.​
In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon
You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost
In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
Life imitates art
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, "Baby, that's alright with me"
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost
When you talk, it's like a movie and you're makin' me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me life isn't that hard
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lostNot even they can stop me now
Boy, I be flying overhead
Their heavy words can't bring me down
Boy, I've been raised from the dead
No one even knows how hard life was
I don't even think about it now because
I've finally found you
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
American dreams came true somehow
I swore I'd chase 'em 'til I was dead
I heard the streets were paved with gold
That's what my father said
No one even knows what life was like
Now I'm in L.A., and it's paradise
I've finally found you
Now my life is sweet like cinnamon
Like a fucking dream I'm living in
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radio
Sweet like cinnamon

Lick me up and take me like a vitamin
'Cause my body's sweet like sugar venom, oh yeah
Baby, love me 'cause I'm playing on the radioMy baby lives in shades of blue
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude
He lives in California too
He drives a Chevy Malibu
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He lives for love, he loves his drugs, he loves his baby too
But I can't fix him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather
But you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable
My baby lives in shades of cool
Cool heart and hands and aptitude
He lives for love, for women too
I'm one of many, Bonnies blue
And when he calls, he calls for me and not for you
He prays for love, he prays for peace and maybe someone new
But I can't help him, can't make him better
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather
'Cause you are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable
Your hot, hot weather in the summer
Hot, hot, neglectful lover
Hot, hot weather in the summer
High, neglectful lover
You're crumbling, sadly
You're crumbling, sadly
You are unfixable
I can't break through your world
'Cause you live in shades of cool
Your heart is unbreakable

Lyin' on my bed, it's a bummer
'Cause I didn't call when I got your number
But I liked you a lot
Slippin' on my dress in soft filters
Everybody said you're a killer
But I couldn't stop the way I was feelin'
The day your record dropped
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
Caught up in my dreams and forgettin'
I've been actin' like armageddon 'cause you
Held me in your arms just a little too tight
That's what I thought
Summer's meant for lovin' and leavin'
I was such a fool for believin' that you
Could change all the ways you've been livin'
But you just couldn't stop
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Your white Mustang
You're revvin' and revvin' and revvin' it up
And the sound, it was frightenin'
And you were gettin' a part of that
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'
White Mustang
Your white Mustang
The day I saw your white Mustang
Said you're a wild mustang
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'
You're gonna hit me like lightnin'White lines, pretty baby, tattoos
Don't know what they mean
They're special, just for you
White palms, baking powder on the stove
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow
I feel you, pretty baby, feel me
Turn it up hot, loving you is free
I like it down, like it down way low
But you already know that
You already know
Come on down to Florida

But I'm comin' up roses
Could it be that I fell for another loser?
I'm cryin' while I'm cummin'
Makin' love while I'm makin' good money
Sobbin' in my cup of coffee
'Cause I fell for another loser
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time
While you're takin' what's mine with the things that you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came
Baby, don't do it
'Cause you got me in my feelings
Talkin' in my sleep again
Talkin' while I'm screamin'

I'm smokin' while I'm runnin'
This town and you better believe it, honey
I'm laughin' as I'm taking no prisoners
And taking down names
I'm cryin' while I'm gunnin'
In the smoke they can hear me comin'
If you were me, and I was you
I'd get out of my way
Get that cigarette smoke out of my face
You've been wastin' my time while you're takin' what's mine
Well, you know what you're doin'
Talk that talk, well, now they all know your name
And there's no comin' back from the place that you came

Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
That's how we played it
And there's no remedy for memory
Your face is like a melody
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me
And telling me that everything is fine
But I wish I was dead
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you
Won't be waiting on the other side
Every time I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you

Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise
Play them like guitars, you're like one of my toys
No holds barred, I’ve been sent to destroy, yeah
Pink flamingos
Always fascinated me
I know what only the girls know
Hoes with lies akin to me
I, I see you're going
So I play my music, watch you leave

Velveteen and living single
It never felt that right to me
I know what only the girls know
Lies can buy eternity
I, I see you leaving

It's comin' in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in hotly and it's coming in strong
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try? But
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without lettin' you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because
Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a song
There's somethin' in the water, I can taste it turnin' sour
It's bitter, I'm coughin', but now it's in my blood
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try? But
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me

Whenever it does, we'll be here for itBlue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne, and white sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
The kids were young and pretty
Where have you been? Where did you go?
Those summer nights seem long ago
And so is the girl you used to call
The Queen of New York City
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come

The power of youth is on my mind
Sunsets, small town, I'm out of time
Will you still love me when I shine
From words but not from beauty?
My father's love was always strong
My mother's glamour lives on and on
Yet still inside, I felt alone
For reasons unknown to me
But if you send for me, you know I'll come
And if you call for me, you know I'll run
I'll run to you, I'll run to you
I'll run, run, run
I'll come to you, I'll come to you
I'll come, come, come
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
And if you call, I'll run, run, run
If you change your mind, I'll come, come, come
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Blue hydrangea, cold cash divine
Cashmere, cologne, and hot sunshine
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine
And we were young and prettyFlames so hot that they turn blue
Palms reflecting in your eyes, like an endless summer
That's the way I feel for you
If time stood still, I'd take this moment, make it last forever
Your halo's full of fire
I'm rising up, rising up
My hot love's full of fire
Love's full of fire
La, ah
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Leather black and eyes of blue 
Sun reflecting in your eyes, like an easy rider
Life makes sense when I'm with you
Looking back, my past
It all seems stranger than a stranger
So let's dance in slow motion
Tear it up, tear it up
Let's dance by the ocean
Ah, ah
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
But when you're nice, baby
You're so amazing in every way
Ooh-ooh
You're cold as ice, baby
I don't wanna fight, baby
It's like I told you
If you stay, I'll stay 
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Screw your anonymity, loving me is all you need
To feel like I do
We could slow dance to rock music, kiss while we do it
Talk 'til we both turn blue
Baby, if you wanna leave, come to California
Be a freak like me, too
Hmmm-hmmm-mmmm
Hmmm-hmmm-mmmmAh, ah
Being a mistress on the side 
It might not appeal to fools like you 
Creeping around on the side
Might not be something you would do
But you haven't seen my man 
You haven't seen my man 
You haven't seen my man 
You haven't seen him 
He's got the fire and he walks with it

I'm trying not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with a star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club, livin' it up
I'm trying not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet, swingin' to the beat
When I know that you're doin' it all for me
And every time you look up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of
You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Time after time, writing my lines
Havin' my baby there next to me
It's so sweet, pourin' you a drink
And pretendin' that nothin' means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Taking our dreams, turning them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?
And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of
You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Front row, every show like a hype man
Sing along, word for word, watchin' my bae
Side stage, fans screamin' causin' migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade
God dang, got a nigga actin' irate
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a-
Love girls, you and I, so who do we trust?
You and I 'til the day we die
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie loveYou are what you are
I don't matter to anyone
But Hollywood legends
Will never grow old
And all of what's hidden
Well, it will never grow cold
But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
And I lost myself when I lost you
And I still get trashed, darling, when I hear your tunes
But you are who you are
I won't change you for anything
For when you are crazy
I'll let you be bad
I'll never dare change thee
To what you are not
But I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got those blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, baby, when I hear your tunes
I put the radio on, hold you tight in my mind
Isn’t strange that you’re not here with me
I’m putting all the lights on and the television
Trying to transmit, can you hear me?
Ground control to Major Tom
Can you hear me all night long?
Ground control to Major Tom
Well, I lost myself when I lost you
But I still got jazz when I've got the blues
I lost myself and I lost you too
And I still get trashed, honey, when I hear your tunes
Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmmm
Mmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
MmmmYou don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, baby
You don't ever have to go faster than your fastest pace
Or faster than my fastest cars
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to reach out, but I never said a thing
I shouldn't have done it, but I read it in your letter
You said to a friend that you wish you were doing better
I wanted to call you, but I didn't say a thing
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long
You don't ever have to be stronger than you really are
When you're lying in my arms, and, honey
You don't ever have to act cooler than you think you should
You're brighter than the brightest stars
You're scared to win, scared to lose
I've heard the war was over if you really choose
The one in and around you
You hate the heat, you got the blues
Changing like the weather, oh, that's so like you
The Santa Ana moves you
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me up
We'll do whatever you want, travel wherever how far
We'll hit up all the old places
We'll have a party, we'll dance 'til dawn
I'll pick up all of your Vogues and all of your Rolling Stones
Your favorite liquor off the top shelf
I'll throw a party all night long
Oh, I'll pick you up
If you come back to America, just hit me up
'Cause this is crazy love, I'll catch you on the flip side
If you come back to California, you should just hit me upEverything I want, I have
Money, notoriety, and rivieras
I even think I found God
In the flashbulbs of the pretty cameras
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras
Am I glamorous?
Tell me, am I glamorous?
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you want to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you
Summertime is nice and hot
And my life is sweet like vanilla is
Gold and silver-lined my heart
But burned into my brain are these stolen images
Stolen images, baby, stolen images
Can you picture it?
Babe, that life, we could've lived
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you
We were two kids just tryin' to get out
Lived on the dark side of the American dream
We would dance all night, play our music loud
But when we grew up, nothing was what it seemed
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing if I can't have youClub queen on the downtown scene
Prowling around at night
You're not mean, you're just born to be seen
Born to be wild
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in but you just can't win
So you hang in the lights
You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them
'Cause you want more 
You want more 
You want more 
'Cause you want more
Young thing on the downtown scene
Rolling around at night
Got things that have yet to be seen
Like your rapper's delight
A little party never hurt no one, that's why it's alright
You want in, but you just can't win
So you stay in the lights
You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them
'Cause you want more 
You want more 
You want more 
'Cause you want more
A little party never hurt no one
So we stay out late
A little party never hurt no one
That's what your friends say
You put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time
Put your life out on the line
You're crazy all the time
You're so Art Deco, out on the floor
Shining like gunmetal, cold and unsure
Baby, you're so ghetto, you're looking to score
When they all say hello, you try to ignore them
'Cause you want more 
You want more 
You want more 
'Cause you want more
A little party never hurt no one
Not you and me
A little party never hurt no one
We were born to be freeCarry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on
It's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong
It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play
Because I'm going deeper and deeper 
Harder and harder 
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
Carry me home, got my new car and my gun
Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listen to a song
Carry me home, don't wanna talk about the things to come
Just put your hands up in the air, the radio on
'Cause there's nothing for us to talk about
Like the future and those things
'Cause there's nothing for me to think about
Now that he's gone, I can't feel nothing
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play
Because I'm going deeper and deeper 
Harder and harder 
Getting darker and darker
Looking for love
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
In all the wrong places
Oh my god
You should've known better
Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather
I got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now
Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day, it's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play
It's not one of those phases I'm going through
Or just a song, it's not one of them
I'm on my own
On my own
On my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own again
I'm on my own againAll the pretty stars shine for you, my love
Am I that girl that you dream of?
All those little times you said that I'm your girl
You make me feel like your whole world
I'll wait for you, babe
That's all I do, babe
Don't come through, babe
You never do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
All those special times I spent with you, my love
They don't mean shit compared to all your drugs
But I don't really mind, I've got much more than that
Like my memories, I don't need that
I wait for you, babe
You don't come through, babe
You never do, babe
That's just what you do
Because I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry
Don't say you need me when
You leave and you leave again
I'm stronger than all my men
Except for you
Don't say you need me if
You know that you're leaving
I can't do it, I can't do it
But you do it well
'Cause I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cry
I'm pretty when I cry, I'm pretty when I cryWe both know that it's not fashionable to love me
But you don't go 'cause, truly, there's nobody for you but me
We could cruise to the blues
Wilshire Boulevard, if we choose
Or whatever you wanna do
We make the rules
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Our honeymoon
Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue
We both know the history of violence that surrounds you
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you
And we could cruise to the news
Pico Boulevard in your used
Little bullet car, if we choose
Mr. "Born to Lose"
Our honeymoon

Say you want me too
Say you want me too
Dark blue
Dark blue
There are violets in your eyes
There are guns that blaze around you
There are roses in between my thighs
Fire that surrounds you
It's no wonder every man in town
Had neither fought nor found you
Everything you do is elusive
To even your honey dew
Our honeymoon

Dreaming away your life

Hmm, mmm

Hmm, hmm, mmmWhat you do to me is indescribable
Got me sparkling just like an emerald
Set my soul on fire and make me wild
Like the deep blue sea
No other boy ever made me feel beautiful
When I'm in your arms, feel like I have it all
Is it your tattoos or golden grill
That makes me feel this way?
Got me spinnin' like a ballerina
Feelin' gangsta every time I see ya
You're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster
Got me spinnin' like a ballerina
You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Got mascara thick, I get emotional
You know, I was more than just a party girl
Isn't hard to see what's going on
I'm so far gone 
When I saw your face, it was incredible
Painted on my soul, it was indelible 
Let's celebrate our twisted fate
We're the broken ones
Got me spinnin' like a ballerina
Feelin' gangsta every time I see ya
You're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster
You got me spinnin' like a ballerina
You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You're the king and baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster, disaster

Ladies and gentlemen, for the very first time!
You got me spinnin' like a ballerina 
Feelin' gangsta every time I see ya 
You're the king and, baby, I'm the queen of
Disaster , disaster

You're the bad boy that I always dreamed of 
You're the king and I'm the beauty queen of
Disaster, disaster
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah!Shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
Did what I had to do
'Cause you're so far past me now
Shared my body and my life with you
That's way over now
There's not more a mind can do
You're so famous now
Got your Bible, got your gun
And you like to party and have fun
And I like my candy and your women
I'm finally happy now that you're gone
Put my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm the best, I'm crazy 
You get a little bit of bourbon in ya
You get a little bit suburban and go crazy 
Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
You dance in circles around me
You're fucking crazy
Oh, oh
You're crazy for me
I shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
I did what I had to do
I found another, anyhow
Shared my body and my mind with you
That's all over now
I did what I had to do
I could see you leaving now
I got your Bible and your gun
And you love to party and have fun
And I love your women and all of your heroin
And I'm so happy now that you're gone
Put my little red party dress on
Everybody knows that I'm a mess, I'm crazy 
Get a little bit of bourbon in ya
You go a little bit suburban and go crazy 
Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
You dance in circles around me
You're fucking crazy
Oh, oh
You're crazy for me
Got your Bible and your gun
You like your women and you like fun

Because you're young, you're wild, you're free
You dance in circles around me
You're fucking crazy
Oh, oh
You're crazy for me
Oh, oh
You're crazy for meWould you be mine?
Would you be my baby tonight?
Could be kissing my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine
'Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got
Don't you know?
It's you that I adore
Though I make the boys fall like dominoes
Kiss me in the d-a-r-k dark tonight
Kiss me in the p-a-r-k park tonight
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down
I could be yours, I could be your baby tonight
Topple you down from your sky 40 stories high
Shining like a God
Can't believe I caught you, and so
Look at what I bought
Not a second thought - oh, Romeo
Kiss me in the d-a-r-k dark tonight
Kiss me in the p-a-r-k park tonight
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down
I want my cake and I want to eat it too
I want to have fun and be in love with you
I know that I'm a mess with my long hair
And my suntan, short dress, bare feet
I don't care what they say about me
What they say about me
Because I know that it's l-o-v-e
You make me happy, you make me happy
And I never listen to anyone
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play
Hey Lolita, hey!
Hey Lolita, hey!
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay
No more skipping rope
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown
Just you and me feeling the heat
Even when the sun goes down"Hey, what you doin'?" Not a lot
Shakin' and movin' at my local spot
Baby, don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Lay, Lady, lay on that side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And I'd be your tiny dancer, honey
I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pourin' rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came
Hey, what you thinkin'? Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinkin' on that old jukebox
But don't ask me why, just swallow some wine
Wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine
Stay, baby, stay on the side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And you'd be my tiny dancer, baby
I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the middle of the pourin' rain
'Cause I adored you
And I just wanted things to be the same
You said you'd meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came
Roses out in your country house
We played guitar in your barn
And everyday felt like Sunday
And I, I wish we had stayed home
And I could put on the radio to our favorite song
Lennon and Yoko, we would play all day long
"Isn't life crazy?", I said now that I'm singin' with Sean
Whoa
I could keep waitin' for you
In the spot we always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, on the pourin' rain
Honey, don't ignore me
I just wanted it to be the same
You said you'd love me like no tomorrow
I guess tomorrow never came 
Tomorrow never came 
Tomorrow never came 
Tomorrow never cameJohn met me down on the boulevard
Cried on his shoulder 'cause life is hard
The waves came in over my head
What you been up to, my baby?
Haven't seen you 'round here lately
All of the guys tell me lies, but you don't
You just crack another beer
And pretend that you're still here
This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear
Joe met me down at the training yard
Cuts on his face 'cause he fought too hard
I know he's in over his head
But I love that man like nobody can
He moves mountains and pounds them to ground again
I watched the guys getting high as they fight
For the things that they hold dear
To forget the things they fear
This is how to disappear
This is how to disappear
Now it's been years since I left New York
I've got a kid and two cats in the yard
The California sun and the movie stars
I watch the skies getting light as I write
As I think about those years
As I whisper in your ear
I'm always going to be right here
No one's going anywhereRemember how we used to party up all night?
Sneaking out and looking for a taste of real life
Drinking in the small town firelight
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walking down the streets as they whistle, "Hi, hi"
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive
There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
While she starts to cry
Mascara running down her little Bambi eyes
"Lana, how I hate those guys"
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen
And that's where the beginning of the end began
Everybody knew that we had too much fun
We were skipping school and drinking on the job
With the boss
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Baby's table dancing at the local dive
Cheering our names in the pink spotlight
Drinking cherry schnapps in the velvet night
Yo, we used to go break into the hotel
Glimmering, we'd swim
Running from the cops in our black bikini tops
Screaming, "Get us while we're hot, get us while we're hot"
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen
The prettiest in-crowd that you had ever seen
Ribbons in our hair, and our eyes gleamed mean
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens
And you know something?
They were the only friends I ever had
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform
Crying 'cause I know I'm never coming back
This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put our love first
Something' that we'd die for, it's a curse
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it
This is what makes us girls
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him
It's all gonna happen, ohI paint my nails black
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown
'Cause you like your women Spanish
Dark, strong and proud
I paint the sky black
You said if you could have your way
You'd make it nighttime all today
So it'd suit the mood of your soul
Oh, what can I do?
Nothing, my sparrow blue
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
I paint the house black
My wedding dress black leather too
You have no room for light
Love is lost on you
I keep my lips red
To seem like cherries in the spring
Darling, you can't let everything
Seem so dark blue
But oh, what can I do
To turn you on or get through you?
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, baby
Black beauty, baby
Oh, what can I do?
Life is beautiful, but you don't have a clue
Sun and ocean blue
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ah
Black beauty, ah-ahBlue is the color of the planet from the view above
Long live our reign, long live our love
Green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
'Til it runs red, runs red with blood
We get so tired and we complain
'Bout how it's hard to live
It's more than just a video game
But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try 
Every day and night 
Blue is the collar of the shirt of the man I love
He's hard at work, hard to the touch
But warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
My heart is soft, my past is rough
But when I love him, get a feeling
Something close to like a sugar rush
It runs through me, but is it wasted love?
But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try 
Every day and night 
Yeah we've gotta try 
We gotta walk through fire 
Because we're just
Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
So beautiful
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
YeahEverything is fine now
Let sleeping dogs lay
All our minds made up now
All our beds are made
No one's out of time, no
Chips fall wherever they may
Leave it all behind
Let the ocean wash away
It never was about the money or the drugs
For you, there's only love
For you, there's only love
It never was about the party or the clubs
For you, there's only love
'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray
Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love
Everything is bright now
No more cloudy days
Even when the storms come
In the eye, we'll stay
No need to survive now
Al we do is play
All I hear is music
Like Lay Lady Lay
It never was about the money or the drugs
With you, there's only love
With you, there's only love
It never was about the party or the clubs
For you, there's only love
'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray
Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your love
'Cause you're my religion, you're how I'm living
When all my friends say I should take some space
Well, I can't envision that for a minute
When I'm down on my knees, you're how I pray
Hallelujah, I need your love
Hallelujah, I need your loveHmmm-mm
Hmmm-mm
Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow skies
It's so crazy, I could drink it like tequila sunrise
Put on that Hotel California
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name
God knows I lived
God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God knows I lost
God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow lights
On Monday, they destroyed me
But by Friday, I'm revived
Put on that Hotel California
Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame
God knows I lived
God knows I died
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I lost
God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
So let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life
Light up my life
Let there be light
Let there be light
Light up my life
Light up my life
God knows I tried

'Cause we gonna take a ride

Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?

Say it's gonna be alright

Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

To a land that's far away
How are we supposed to get there

You talk lots about God
Freedom comes from the call
But that's not what this bitch wants
Not what I want at all
I want money, power and glory
I want money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah, I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah, I'm gonna take them for all that they got
Baby…
The sun also rises on those who fail the call
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls
I can do it if you really, really like that
I know what you really want, b-baby
I can do it if you think you like that
You should run, boy, run
I want money, power and glory

Baby…All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing black to their house parties
Crosby, Stills and Nash is playing
Wine is flowing with Bacardi
But sometimes, girls just want to have fun
The poetry inside of me is warm like a gun
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo-free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bartender, bar-t-t-tender
All the ladies of the canyon
Wearing white for their tea parties
Playing games of levitation
Meditating in the garden
And I love the little games that we play
From the valley to the beach
And when at last the day is done, I grab my keys
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
It'll buy me a year if I play my cards right
Photo-free exits from baby's bedside
'Cause they don't yet know what car I drive
I'm just tryna keep my love alive
With my bartender, hold me all night
Bartender, our love's alive
Baby, remember, I'm not drinking wine
But that Cherry Coke you serve is fine
And our love's sweet enough on the vine
Bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender, bar-t-t-tender
Ha, ha, ha, ha
I bought me a truck in the middle of the night
60 MPH on PCH drive
Here to Long Beach to Newport by your side
As they don't yet know where I reside
60 miles from the last place I hide
With my bar-t-t-tender, hold me all night
Bar-t-t-tender, keep love alive
Bar-t-t-tenderWish I may, wish I might
Find my one true love tonight
Do you think that he could be you?
If I pray really tight
Get into a fake bar fight
While I'm walking down the avenue
If I lay really quiet
I know that what I do isn't right
I can't stop what I love to do
So I murder love in the night
Watching them fall one by one, they fight
Did you think you'll love me too?
Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
'Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much 
You can see me drinking Cherry Cola
Sweet serial killer
I left a love note
Said, you know I love the thrill of the rush
You know I love the thrill of the rush
Sweet serial killer
Do it for the thrill of the rush
Love you just a little too much, much
Sweet serial killer
I love you just a little too much
Love you just a little too much, much
My black fire's burning bright
Maybe I'll go out tonight
We can paint the town in blue
I'm so hot, I ignite
Dancing in the dark and I shine
Like a light, I'm luring you
Sneak up on you really quiet
Whisper, "Am I what your heart desires?"
I can be your ingenue
Keep you safe and inspired
Baby, let your fantasies unwind
We can do what you want to do
Baby, I'm a sociopath
Sweet serial killer
On the warpath
'Cause I love you just a little too much
I love you just a little too much 
You can see me drinking Cherry Cola
Sweet serial killer

Love you just a little too much, much
Just have fun
I don't want one

Just have fun

La-la, la-la, la, la-la, la-la, lie down, down
Oh!

Marilyn's my mother
Jesus is my bestest friend
We don't need nobody
'Cause we got each other
Or at least I pretend
We get down every Friday night
Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric
Sing that body electric
Sing that body electric
I'm on fire
Sing that body electric
Whitman is my daddy
Monaco's my mother

Suicide's her father
Opulence is the end

Dancing and grinding in the pale moonlight

We're feeling alright
Mary prays the rosary for my broken mind
I sing the body electric
I sing the body electric, baby
I sing the body electric

Sing that body electric
My clothes still smell like you
And all the photographs say you're still young
I pretend I'm not hurt
And go about the world like I'm having fun
We get crazy every Friday night
Drop it like it's hot in the pale moonlight
Grand Ole Opry
We're feeling alright
Mary's swaying softly to her heart's delight

Holding me tight in our final hour
I don't know how you convince them and get them, boy
I don't know what you do, it's unbelievable
And I don't know how you get over, get over
Someone as dangerous, tainted, and flawed as you
One for the money, two for the show
I love you, honey; I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?
You got the world, but baby, at what price?
It's something so strange, it's hard to define
It isn't that hard, boy, to like you or love you
I'd follow you down, down, down, 'cause you're unbelievable
If you're going crazy, just grab me and take me
I'd follow you down, down, down; anywhere, anywhere
One for the money, two for the show
I love you, honey; I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?
One for the money, two for the show
I love you, honey; I'm ready, I'm ready to go
How did you get that way? I don't know
You're screwed up and brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?
I don't know
You're screwed up, you're brilliant
You look like a million dollar man
So why is my heart broke?Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why work so hard when you could just be free?
You got your money now, you got your legacy
Let's leave the world for the ones who change everything
Nothing could stop the two of us
Let's just get lost, that's what we want
And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave, it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Dive in, dive deep and dive blue, my sweet
Rushing up from the water where the ice meets
And you've been gone so long, you missed everything
The world can change in a day if you go away
But nothing could stop the two of us
If that's what we want, we could just get lost
And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
With just one wave, it goes away
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Do you like
Do you like where you've been?
Where you're going to ?
Say goodnight
Say goodnight to the life and the world you knew
I'm going to follow you
And I will never sing again
And you won't work another day
I will never sing again
You won't work another day
It will be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Be our swan song
It will be our swan song
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Put your white tennis shoes on and follow me
Why you work so hard when you could just be free?I was at Coachella, leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it, 'cause, baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next mornin', they put out the warnin'
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music, tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night
'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents?
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third time
I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven 
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it 
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend 
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
I was at Coachella, leaning on your shoulder
Watching your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breaking 'em down
With his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds
What about all these children and all their children's children
And why am I even wondering that today?
Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way
I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven 
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it 
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend 
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask him one question
A stairway, stairway to heaven
A stairway
Got a million things I wanna say
Like, what's it all for? Will it be okay?
Million things I wanna say
Like, what's it all for?
Stairway, stairway to heaven
Stairway
Stairway, stairway to heaven
StairwayGirls, don't forget your pearls and all of your horses
As you make your way across the pond
Girls, don't forget your curls and all of your corsets
Memorize them in a little song
Shake it up, throw your hands up and get loose
Cut a rug, lean into the fuckin' youth
Choreo, we just want the fuckin' truth
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?
Is it the end of an era?
Is it the end of America?

We just kept dancin'
When the world was at war before
We just kept dancin'
Boys, don't forget your toys
And take all of your money
If you find you're in a foreign land
Boys, don't make too much noise
And don't try to be funny
Other people may not understand

Man to man, heart to heart
I love you but you drive me so far
Wish you well on that star

There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You let me in, don't leave me out, or leave me dry
Even when I'm alone, I'm not lonely
I hear the sweetest melodies 
On the fire escapes of the city
Sounds like I am free 
God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
May you stand proud and strong like Lady Liberty shinin' all night long
God bless America
Take me as I am, don't see me for what I'm not
Only you can hear me tonight
Keep your light on, babe, I might be standin' outside
You let me in, don't leave me out, or leave me dry

Feels like I am free

Even with you, I've got no one to lose
So you'd better believe that nobody can make me feel lonely
Because I hear 
Even when you talk that talk with the lights on
I still somehow know that I'll never feel, ever feel lonely
I have no fear 
God bless America, and all the beautiful women in it
God bless America, and all the beautiful people in it
May they stand proud and strong like Lady Liberty shinin' all night long
God bless America, and all the beautiful people in it
And all the beautiful people in itThere's only 24 hours in a day
And half as many ways for you to lie to me, my little love
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those, you lay awake
With thoughts of murder and carnage
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the company you keep
There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm
There's only 24 hours in a day
And half of those you lay
Between the sheets with me, my lying love
There's only 24 hours, so you'd say
For most of them you pay
For all the things they paid you for, my love
If you lie down with dogs, then you'll get fleas
Be careful of the ones you choose to leave
There's only 24 hours
And that's not enough
To lie like you lie
Or love like you love
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm
Give me your heat
Give me your diamonds
You hit that street
And my crooked words
You count to three
While they're all dying
You're hard to reach
You're cold to touch
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-da-da-da
La-da-da-di-da-da-daMy baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy, smokin' on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck
And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had ’til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
'Cause we were just that good
It was just that good
Whatever’s on tonight‚ I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight‚ I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was '70s in spirit‚ '90s in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time
And we were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
That we gave all we had 'til the time we got to bed
'Cause we knew we could
We were so obsessed with writing the next best American record
’Cause we were just that good
It was just that good
Whatever’s on tonight, I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I’m taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu and I want it
It's you‚ all the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do, all the things that I say
It's true, all the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love
The way Bill plays guitar
Whatever’s on tonight‚ I just wanna party with you
Topanga's hot tonight, I'm taking off my bathing suit
You make me feel like
There's something that I never knew I wanted
We play the Eagles down in Malibu and I want it
There's something that I never knew I wantedThe other woman
Has time to manicure her nails
The other woman
Is perfect where her rival fails
And she's never seen with pin curls
In her hair anywhere
The other woman
Enchants her clothes with French perfume
The other woman
Keeps fresh cut flowers in each room
And there are never toys that's scattered everywhere
And when her old man comes to call
He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen
'Cause to be by her side
It's such a change from old routine
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
The other woman
Will always cry herself to sleep
The other woman
Will never have his love to keep
And as the years go by, the other woman
Will spend her life alone
Alone
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Baby, do, do
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, oh
Oh, oh
AloneGargoyles standing at the front of your gate
Trying to tell me to wait, but I can't wait to see you
So I run like I'm mad to heaven's door
I don't wanna be bad, I won't cheat you no more
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby
Spotlight, bad baby, you've got a flair
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
Mon amour, sweet child of mine, you're divine
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's okay to shine?
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby
Don't be afraid of me
Don't be ashamed
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection
Idol of roses, iconic soul
I know your name
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Grenadine, sunshine, can you fade inside of mine?
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, babyBaby, you understand me now?
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood
You know sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem edgy
I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on all you
Life has its problems
And I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do
'Cause I love you
Oh baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes I find myself alone, regretting
Some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord, please, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstoodLet's get out of this town, baby, we're on fire
Everyone around here seems to be going down, down, down
If you stick with me, I can take you higher and higher
It feels like all of our friends are lost
Nobody's found, found, found
I got so scared, I thought no one could save me
You came along, scooped me up like a baby
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face, and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time
Boy, get into my car, got a bad desire
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now
You're a careless con and you're a crazy liar, but baby
Nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down
I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face, and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time
Feels like, feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love for the first time
Feels like, you know it feels like
Falling in love
Every now and then, the stars align
Boy and girl meet by the great design
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?
Everybody told me love was blind
Then I saw your face, and you blew my mind
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this timeTime present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future
And time future contained in time past
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-gardenHeavy metal love of mine
I should have learned to let you stay
You didn't want me all the time
But you were worth it anyway
'Cause you were so much better
Than the rest of them
Out of all the others
You were the honest man
He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses
Motorcycle love divine
I should have learned to let you play
I wasn't the marrying kind
I should have done it anyway
We should have left Las Vegas
And then began again
Took your bike to Detroit
Back to the promised land
He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses
I can feel it coming in the air tonight
See you walking on that blue Pacific
I can see you bathing in the summer light
Turning tan and you look terrific
You got game boy, game boy
You got game boy, game boy
You got game boy, game boy
You got game
He loved guns and roses
Guns and roses
He loved guns and roses
He loved guns
And roses, roses, roses
He loved guns and roses 
Guns and roses 
He loved guns and roses 
He loved guns 
And roses , roses , roses
Roses, roses, rosesAnd the spirit of John moved upon the face of the waters;
And John said "Let there be light" and there was light;
And John saw that it was good
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us for our sins
Creator of all forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins
Thank you God
I wanna tell you where you're at, you lose me in this campsite, and I'm gonna teach you how to be cowboys;
Now, if you wanna be tough cowboys I don't wanna hear ya' crying, I don't wanna hear ya' bellyaching, you gotta get on that horse and ride; 
And don't be afraid, wear your boats up high, your pant low; 
with your head in a good way, 
And when you get on there don't be jerkin' on it, just ride nice and soft
You can do it; 
I believe in ya', ride with the wind,  
don't complain and never say you're sorry, sorry is a sign of weakness, 
I don't want you go back to your mama because I'll run you back out   
You're a good kid, all you lil' cowboy will do a good job for me
make sure you do it children, 'cause I'll be watching you
  
Don't forget, I'll write to your mama 
I sing the Body electric;
The armies of those I love engirt me, and I engirt them;
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, 
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul
Womanhood, and all that is woman - and the man that comes from woman
The womb, the tits, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and rising
The voice, articulation
Language
Whispering, shouting aloud
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep
Walking, swimming, poise on the hips
Leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth
And around the eyes
The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair
The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body
The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees
The thin red jellies within you or within me - the bones and the marrow in the bones
The exquisite realization of health;
Oh I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the Soul
Oh I say now, these are the Soul!
- "You know it's not always gonna be this way, right?"
- "Yeah.."
- "So just chill, alright?"
- "Mhmm"
- "Alright.."
- "Yeah."
In honor of Jack's birthday tonight, I thought bring somebody here tonight that Jack can jack off to. 
No, with seriousness, are you ready? Ladies...
I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked
Dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix
Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night
Who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz
Who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated
Who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war
Who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull
Who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall
Who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York
Who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night
With dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares
And so, from being created in his likeness, to being banished for wanting to be too much like him, we were cast out, and the garden of Eden transformed in to the garden of Evil
Los Angeles, The city of Angels, A land of Gods and Monsters, The in-between realm where only the choices made from your free will, will decide your souls final fate
Some poets called it the entrance to the Underworld, but on some summer nights, it could feel like Paradise, Paradise Lost
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Master of the Universe, creator of all forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John
You ask me why I love her? Well give me time, I'll explain
Have you ever seen a Kansas sunset or an Arizona rain?
Have you ever drifted on a bayou down Louisiana way?
Or watched a cold fog come drifting in over San Francisco Bay?
Have you heard a bobwhite calling in the Carolina pines
Or heard the bellow of a diesel at the Appalachia mines?
Does the call of Niagara thrill you when you hear her waters roar?
Or do you look with awe and wonder, Massachusetts shore
Brave new men who stepped on Plymounth's rock?
And do you think of them when you stroll along a New York City dock?
Have you seen a snowflake drifting in the Rockies, way up high?
Or seen the sun come blazing down from a bright Nevada sky?
Do you hail to the Columbia as she rushes to the sea
Or bow your head at Gettysburg at our struggle to be free?
You ask me why I love her? I've got a million reasons why:
It's my beautiful America, beneath God's wide, wide skyIf you dance, I'll dance
And if you don't, I'll dance anyway
Give peace a chance
Let the fear you have fall away
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
If you go, I'll stay
You come back, I'll be right here
Like a barge at sea
In the storm, I stay clear
'Cause I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
If you dance, I'll dance
I'll put my red dress on again
And if you fight, I'll fight
It doesn't matter, now it's all gone
I've got my mind on you
I've got my mind on you
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
Say yes to heaven
Say yes to me
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you
I've got my eye on you
I've got my mind on youTook a trip to San Francisco
All  our friends said we would jive
Didn't  work, so I left for Fresno
It was quite a scenic drive
Pulled over to watch the children in the park
We  used to only worry for them after dark
I’m  still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No  bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It’s just a dream I had in mind
I  flew back to New York City
Missed that Hudson River line
Took a train up to Lake Placid
That's another place and time, where
I used to go to drive-ins and listen to the blues
So many things that I think twice about before I do now
I'm still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mind
It's just a dream I had in mindAre you gonna hurt me now?
Or are you gonna hurt me later?
Are you gonna go to town?
Maybe you should play it safer
You've got me all dressed up tonight
Springsteen on the radio
You've got me all freaked out tonight
Somethin' you're telling me, what? - I don't know
You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry, but
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside you could catch me again
Drinks on the patio
Are you gonna tell me now?
Are you gonna tell me later?
'Cause if you think that I don't know
I'm gonna have to say you're crazy
I'm getting all dressed up tonight
Dressed up just to hear you, boy
I already know what you got in store
Why I go? - Baby, I don't know
'Cause you don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry, but
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch me again
So you think you're in charge?
Do you?
Acting like a big shot
I'm sure
So you think you're in charge?
Do you?
You're acting like a big shot
You don't wanna break me down
You don't wanna say goodbye and
You don't wanna turn around
You don't wanna make me cry but
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside I could catch you again
You caught me once
​Maybe on the flipside you could catch me againI know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that look in your eyes is so familiar, a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream
I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that gleam in your eyes is so familiar, a gleam
And I know it's true that visions are seldom what they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dreamMy baby used to dance underneath my architecture
To the Houses of the Holy
Smokin' on them cigarettes
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was cool as heck
He was cool as heck
But you were so obsessed
With writing the next best American record
But there was nothing left by the time we got to bed
Baby, that's a shame
You were so obsessed
With writing the next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now
You did it all for fame
How does that taste coming out?
You did it all for fame
Baby, how's life treating you now?
It's over
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
He was 70s in spirit, 90s in his frame of mind
My baby used to dance underneath my architecture
We lost track of space
We lost track of time
But you were so obsessed
With writing the next best American record
But there was nothing left by the time we got to bed

You were so obsessed
With writing the next best American record
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame
You did it all for fame
Tell me how it treats you now

How does that taste coming out?
Now that you lost the game
Honey, how's life treating you now that it's over?
Baby, how you feeling now that I told you?
It's you
All the roads lead to you
Everything I want and do
All the things that I say
It's true
All the roads lead to you
Like the 405 I drive through
Every night and every day
I see you for who you really are
Why the thousands of girls love
The way Bill plays guitar?

Is the sun in your eyes, easy rider?
Do the flame-colored skies light your fire?
We are heavy metal lions
They will never understand
The kind of people you or I am
Bow your heads and take your hands
They were angels forever 
Forever angels 
They were angels forever 
Forever angels 
They were angels forever
Forever angels
They were angels forever
Forever angels
Does the ocean inspire, easy rider?
Do the stars and the wind take you higher?
You are California proud
You are angels of the night
Rock 'n' roll guardians now
The last keepers of the light
They were angels forever 
Forever angels 
They were angels forever 
Forever angels 
They were angels forever 
Forever angels 
They were angels forever 
Forever angels 
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Paradise is a hell-colored flame sky
Is it nice to feel free and wild?
Paradise is a game of do or die
I just ride, ride, ride
They were angels forever 
Forever angels 
Forever angels
They were angels forever 
Forever angels 
They were angels forever 
Forever angels 
They were angels forever 
Forever angels 
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ahEvery Saturday night, I get dressed up to ride for you, baby
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you, baby
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care
You ask me where I've been; I been everywhere
But I don't want to be nowhere but here
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
 
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
 
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care 
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
Every Saturday night I seem to come alive for you, baby
Santa Monica, I'm racing in the lights for you, baby
I drive fast, radio blares
Have to touch myself to pretend you're there
Your hands were on my hips, your name was on my lips
Over, over again like my only prayer
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
 
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
 
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care 
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it
I'm trying to get to you, baby
I'm feeling scared and you know it
I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it

I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care 
I've got a burning desire for you, babyShe wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
From the stars
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Love was ours
Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of
Blue velvet
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
Through the years
And I still can see blue velvet through my tearsYou taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my
I love you but I don’t know why…
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don’t let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don’t let it stop
He had a cigarette with his number on it
He gave it over to me, “Do you want it?”
I knew it was wrong but I palmed it
I saved it, I waited, I called it
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on your lips makes you dangerous
I knew it was wrong, I’m beyond it
I tried to be strong but I lost it
You taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my…
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot

Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don’t let it stop
He has a white corvette like I want it
A fire in his eyes, know, I saw it
He’s bleeding from his brain and his wallet
He’s sick and he’s taken but honest
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on his lips I just can’t resist
As close as I’ll get to the darkness
He tells me to, “Shut up, I got this”
You taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my…
You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot

Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot
Don’t let it stop
I need you, I need you babe
Like I never needed anyone
You’re wrong but you’re so much fun
You say you treat 'em mean
To keep 'em keen
But you, you're not that nice
But you taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my…

You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don’t let it stop
You can be the boss, daddy

You know that I like, like you a lot

Sitting on your lap, singing you my song, ooh-ooh-ooh
Got a lollipop
I'll give you some
All for you-you-you-you-you-you
You can be my daddy tonight-night-night
I'm neon phosphorescent
Open like a Christmas present, oh
You can be my daddy tonight-night-night
If you're seeking heaven
Then you wanna come and get it, get it
You can be my daddy tonight-night-night
I'm neon phosphorescent
Open like a Christmas present, oh
You can be my daddy tonight-night-night
If you're seeking heaven
Then you wanna come and get it alright
Be my daddy tonight
What's up
What's up
What's up
What's up
Be my daddy
Be my daddy
Be my daddy
Be my, be my daddy tonightI wore diamonds for the birth of your baby
For the birth of your son
On the same day, my husband-to-be
Packed his things to run
Was bittersweet to say the least
One life begins, one comes undone
I've always been a strong woman of faith
Strong like a tree, but the unlucky one
I'm going down now
With all of my
Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden
I wore diamonds for the day of our wedding
For our day in the sun
On the same day, my mother-to-be said she wouldn't come
It's always been that way with me
No time for change, no time for fun
It's always been that way, it seems
One love begins, one comes undone
I'm going down now
With all of my
Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
Blue, ah, blue
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
All of my, all of my fine china
Blue, ah
Fine china and fresh linen
All of my dresses with them tags still on them
Fine china and dull silver
My white horses and my ivory almonds
I guess they really got the best of us, didn't they?
They said that love was enough, but it wasn't
The Earth shattered, the sky opened
The rain was fire, but we were wooden
Fine china, fine china, fine china
Fresh linen, fresh linen, fresh linen
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah

Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ahYou were the freak king of the piercing shop
All the girls thought they could sing
But they’re really not, shit, I don’t get it
You’re looking like a man, you’re talking like a baby
How the fuck is your song in a Coke commercial? Crazy
I don’t get it, your taste once exquisite
What happened to Brooklyn?
What happened to New York?
What happened to my scene?
What happened to punk rock, rock?
You called me the queen of the downtown scene, babe
How the fuck would you go switch it up and then replace me?
I don’t get it, I’m so legit
Tell me, was it ’cause I wasn’t platinum in jewels?
That perhaps, you thought I was a little bit of an uncool
Kid, was that it?
Stefani, you suck, I know you’re selling twenty million
Wish they could have seen you when we booed you off in Williamsburg
You’re hurt, I know my words don’t hurt ya
Oh, girl, I see you walking ’round in your pearls
Thinking that you’re number one
You’re so funny, ’cause honey, you’re not
What happened to Brooklyn, the last frontier?
They said you could make it anywhere if you can make it here
But where?
No magic in the air
What happened to Brooklyn?
What happened to our scene, baby?
Have we all gone Gaga crazy?
Remember when the streets used to be dangerous
And we were born bad?
And we were born bad?
Punk rock, punk rock
The boys used to punch each other in the face
And girls were walking 'round wasted
Everyone had a good night, come back in sunlight
Punk rock, rock, rockIf you get lonely, think of me only
Prison isn't going to keep me from you
Remember Coney Island and how we
Went into the water, 'til the waves turned blue?
Nobody does have to know that our love's alive
Keep it on the low if you want to hide
Got that same address if you want to write
One Greenwich Avenue, wishing and thinking of you
Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes
If you get lonely, think of this only
Heaven hasn't forgotten about you
Though you can't hold me, pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call on your ex girl, boo
I won't tell a single soul how you spend your nights
In that single cell, holding your pillow tight
If you really are afraid, then you ought to know
That you're the one I want, the one I want forever more
Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes
I know you get scared sometimes, boy
Nothing to be feared when you're in my heart
Troubles come in threes but in your case
They came in millions and trillions, but that's all right
Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and white
Like TV in black and whiteCarry me off the stage
I can't do this anymore
Been gone for 3 years
Is that enough for you boy?
Carry me to my bed, paint my toe nails blue
Tell me all about the things that you and I will never do
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
Carry me off the stage
Had too much to drink
Been on tour too long
And I've had too much time to think
Carry me to my bed
Lay me in a pillow town
Kiss me on my head
And remind me of the way we will not know
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, laying in Versailles
You and I get to know one another
Late at night, baby you're my sign
Call me late if you wanna get high
Late at night, baby you and I
Can get to know one another
Cause late at night, we have one life to kill
Oh You and I
Can get to know the thrill
Cause baby you're my sign
And I wanna get to know ya
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
Ah
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
I wish I was your girl
AhUnderstand this, I’m not looking for true love tonight
If you wanna be my little baby
You can meet me in the pale moonlight
I been workin’ every day 8 to 9 and
Serving coke and fries at the movie blue drive-in
If you want me, you know where to find me
I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don’t wanna care tonight, I don’t wanna fight
You don’t have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby
Understand this, I been likin’ you since I was small
I don’t wanna get you runnin’ scared
When there’s no pressure there at all
I been workin’ 8 to 9 every day
And think about you almost all the time, all the time and
If I wanna see you, I drive by
I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don’t wanna care tonight, I don’t wanna fight
You don’t have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, baby
I’m the sweetest girl in town so why are you so mean?
When you gonna ditch that stupid  you got?
It’s me you should be seein’
Hello-o-o you are lookin’ so fine, so fine
Fantasy about you’s like a gold mine, gold mine
Askin' everybody, “Is he mine? Is he mine?”
Not quite yet, but I’m gonna get-get him
Not quite yet, but I’m gonna get-get him!
I can be your one time baby
I can be your little dairy queen
I don’t wanna care tonight, I don’t wanna fight
You don’t have to give me anything
Just put your sweet kiss, kiss on my lips now, babyBoy, it's late, walk me home, put your hand in mine
At the gate, stop and say, "be my valentine"
You are, by far, the brightest star
I've ever seen, and I never dreamed
I'd be so happy that I could die
You used to say that I was beautiful like Cleopatra
But you the king, too, so I would say, "back at ya"
I flip my hair and make you stare and put my makeup on
And make up stories 'bout my life and put on very cherry bomb
And even then, I knew that we were something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts like radio to Sirius
I'd see you in the hall like, "hello, hello"
Up against the wall like, "let's go, let's go"
Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?
If you're lonely, baby, hold me, you're my only one
Watching television, kissing 'til we see the sun
So far, we are safe in the dark
And I never dreamed that I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy that I could die
You used to call yourself The Don and call me Queen Diana
You always make me blush and say, "shut up boy, you bananas!"
You pull my hair and push me down and chase me, make me run
You played me Biggie Smalls, and then my first Nirvana song
So even then, when no one's friends were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way you looked in second period
I'd see you in the hall like, "hello, hello"
Up against the wall like, "let's go, let's go"
Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?
I know that they say that all I want
Is to have fun
And get away for rainy days
I know that they think I've come undone
But I'm in love, I wanna run, run, run away
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?
Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?Hold me in your arms
Love me like your best friends did
Promise I won't hurt you, kid
Hold me really tight until the stars look big
Never let me go
All the world is ours
Like they say in Scarface, kid
You can push your drugs and I can make it big
Singing at CBGB's, have a real good gig
Hey, you never know
'Cause, baby, we were born to live fast and die young
Born to be bad, have fun
Honey, you and me can be one
Just believe, come on
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay
We gonna go far
I can already taste it, kid
L.A.'s gonna look real good
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big
Never let me go
Send me to the stars
Tell me when I get there, kid
I can be your Nancy, you can be my Sid
Get into some trouble like our parents did
Hey, they'll never know
'Cause baby, we were born to be bad and move on
Built to go fast and stay strong
Honey, you and me, and no one
Just believe, come on
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stay
I remember when I saw you for the first time
You were laughing, sparkling like a new dime
I came over, "Hello, can you be mine?
Can you be mine? Can you be mine?"
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Baby, it's a sweet life, sing it like a song
It's a short trip, only getting one
Can count on you, my love, more than anyone?
Never let me go
If you love me hardcore, then don't walk away
It's a game, boy, I don't wanna play
I just wanna be yours, like I always say
Never let me go
Boy, we're in a world war, let's go all the way
Put your foot to the floor, really walk my way
Tell me that you need me more and more everyday
Never let me go, just stayYou smell like a million roses
Bathed in rock 'n' roll
Ours was the greatest
Love story ever told
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold
That's my baby
He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart that would beat
Like a bass for his baby doll
One in a million, inimitable soul
That's my baby
Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold
You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy
He was the king of the town
With a crown that would never fall
A heart like a bass that would beat for his baby doll
Mind like a diamond
An un-imitable song
That's my baby
Young or old, summer or cold
Young or old, summer or cold
You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy
It drives me crazy
You've got it
And I want it
Late summer nights in July, flaunt it
You know that you can always come home
To the one who gave you your name
'Cause I see a light in your eyes
It's so bright, and
The skies, they open wide for you
So come to me, my baby
You've got a way
Like JFK when you do it
The way that you move it
Spins me around like a record, baby
And you've got a soul like no one I know
You're so new at it
The way you see through that shit
Breaks my heart, and it drives me crazy
It drives me crazy
It drives me crazy
Crazy, oh, oh-ohOn the streets of LA
Where the future is now
We dance like nobody is watching us
And we live like we want to
But it can all get a little crazy
Unless there's something to hold on to
For me, that was true love
I was a young girl, selfish and wild
Like a fire in L.A
Hot like the summer and mean like a child
Who keeps crying 'til she gets her way
There were roses in my hair
Rock and roll on blare and I was in trouble
No one could rock me like you could
I was a bad girl gone good
Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only dream
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
And it brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you
It was a mad world, we lived for fun
And we got shit for free
Had a face like an angel but inside my heart
Was as black as a broke movie screen
But then I saw you standing there
Like a millionaire, give me your number
Call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you did
Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only dream
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
And it brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you
It isn't hard to see you've got a hold on me
Give me your money, love me to death
Talk like a baby cause I'm so elated
He tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yet
I don't wanna lose it
I'm in love but I didn't choose it
Roses in my hair, dancing in the air
Feels like I'm flying
Tell me you love me, boy, do it
It's just like I thought, I just knew it
Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only dream
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
And it brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you
Yeah, it's all because of youCarry me up them stairs
Put my white socks on
And my pretty song
You like my blue nail polish?
"What is all this?", you said
"The mess upstairs
Don't be scared"
Daddy dearest, you know
How I like to take trips
Pops, first stop at the K-Mart
Buy me my peach lip gloss
Cigarettes and lollipops
Mad magazines, and white socks
All in your car for
Our trip across the U.S.A
We going to party
Like it's 1949
We in the Pontiac
From July to July
It's a flower motel nation
Day and night on our last vacation
We going to see it all
Before we say goodbye
Daddy likes Blackpool
Pleasure Beach and road stops
Baby likes some Swiss Alps
Souvenir gift shops
Late night, midnight
Radio show talks
Daddy, baby
Big jail break
Ponytail and lollipops
Dinerettes and soda pops
New blue bathing suit
Ruched tops and Cadillacs
Blue lake car to Dunks
Hopscotch, shit talk
Alabama hard knocks
Motel brass locks
We going to party
Like it's 1949
We in the Pontiac
From July to July
It's a motel flower nation
Day and night on our last vacation
We going to see it all
Before we say goodbyeBound up the stairs
I'm in the shower
Do you know
I am going to leave you?
Do you know
I am going to leave you?

Little ghost, tall, tan like milk and honey
You're very brave and very free

On your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell me
Swing it high like Jesus, wild and free
Dandelions in your hair, baby

Your sycamore tree
What you don't tell no one, you can tell meWell, I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things go
Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me
Gold metal flowers dangling
And I almost cried as I sold them off
And I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no, no
But I got to get to and from where I come
And it's gonna take money to go
Oh, no
Oh-oh, oh-ohh, oh-ohh
Oh-ohh
In the name of higher consciousness
I let the best man I knew go
Cause it's nice to love and be loved
But it's better to know all you can know
I said it's nice to love and be loved
But I'd rather know what God knows
Oh, no
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no
Oh, no
I can't do this once more
No man can keep me together
Been broken since I was born
Well, I didn't know it would come to this but
That's what happens when you're on your own
And you're alright with letting nice things goOne day, my hoops will be made of diamonds
My knuckles made of real gold
I'll spend my days getting high with all my friends
In the glamorous and green old part of Hollywood
Sun will rise, I'm a supernova
Body electric and I dance like Morrison
When the night begins, baby comes alive again
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
In Hollywood
I'm alive again
I'm alive again
One day, I'll drive in a gold Mercedes Benz
Singing opera on Bel Air Road
Hair to my ass will be flying in the wind
Shootin' heroin and speedballs
See the sea, I'm a supernova
I walk on water and I dance like Joplin
When the sun descends, I dive into the waves again
In Hollywood
In Hollywood

I can feel that you're the one for me
You'll be my first, and you'll be my last

You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true
You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver pole
I did what I had to do
Femme fatale, always on the run
Diamonds on my wrist
Whiskey on my tongue
Before I get bad, I gotta get drunk
So get over here
Pour me a cold one
Babe, you can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
Sparkling in sequins, say, hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck
Wrong, I know, killing someone
It gets a little easier when you've done it once
You know that I'm fun, you know that I'm young
So tell me you're mine
Let's get it on
Babe, you can see that I'm danger
Glamorous, but I'm deranged, yeah
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
I said it really nicely, so can you be my savior?
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck
I was a dangerous girl
You were too nice for this world
And now I'm back on the prowl
Who wants to give it a whirl?
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luckDown, down, down
Mm, Uh-huh
Huh, let's go!
When you got her in the back seat
Drivin' round the back streets
Trying to block me out
Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard
Does it light up the spark?
Is she a Ride-or-Die Bitch?
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart?
You can try to fight it
I have left my mark on you
There is nothing you can do
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
 I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me
When you take her to Chateau Marmont
'Cause you booked the top suite
Lay her on the bed
Strip her down to her bare ass
In her Kiki de Montparnasse
Like I used to have
Is she a Ride-or-Die Bitch?
Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did?
It won't be the same again
She don't compare to who I am
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
 I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me
You try to forget and you tell her that you miss her
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get a hot rush feeling on your lips
It's me taking over you, throwing you a curveball
Reminding you of our true romance and
Just like the first time you learned to dance and
I showed you all those moves she can't do
She's not me 
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
 I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me
When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
 I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not meI can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly
I had bright wishes in the summer, I was bathing in sunlight
Painting in the garden like a ghost in mid-July
Running fast from something with my eyes wide like
Saucers spinning in the sun
I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly
Your lies were hot kisses in the summer
I was dreaming of a lake
Dreaming of the water where I'd rise like a phoenix
Or an iron from the fire
I've got things to tell you like I know that you're a liar
I had a dream that I was fine
I wasn't crazy, I was divine
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can fly
Your words cut like a knife in butter
I was fighting for my art
Fighting with my lover, you had me so tied up
Thinking there's no other
Yeah, right
Yeah, right
I can fly
You had me caged up like a bird in midsummer
You saw me waiting, I was crazy, on fire, waiting to fly
I can flyStrawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
I walked in town on silver spurs that jingled to
A song that I had only sang to just a few
She saw my silver spurs and said lets pass some time
And I will give to you summer wine
Oh, Summer wine
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, Summer wine
My eyes grew heavy and my lips, they could not speak
I tried to get up but I couldn't find my feet
She reassured me with an unfamiliar line
And then she gave to me more summer wine
Mm, Summer wine
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, Summer wine
When I woke up, the sun was shining in my eyes 
My silver spurs were gone, my head felt twice its size
She took my silver spurs, a dollar and a dime
And left me cravin' for more summer wine
Oh, uh, Summer wine
Strawberries, cherries and an angel's kiss in spring
My summer wine is really made from all these things
Take off your silver spurs and help me pass the time
And I will give to you summer wine
Mm, Summer wine
Mm, Summer wine
Mm, Summer wine
Ta ta da, ta da ta ta
Tu tu tu du, tu da
Tu tu tu da, tu da
Ah, ahLilacs in my mind all the time are blooming beautifully
Even though some stare and say her last affair went brutally
Well, I don't let them rain on my parade
That's not my thing
'Cause I've got love on my side, now
I've got nothing to hide, now
And now life's a dream

Back to Malibu in our trailer park for two
We're like Sid and Nancy loving the fight
We got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
My man's crazy and his mind isn't right
But I like him, fact, I love him
I can't get e-enough of him
He knows only I can save him tonight
I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
Told you a million times before
Yes, I'm up for it a million more
I'm tired of fighting you
Seems like everything I do
Even when I win, I lose wit' you, man
And it's not somethin' you choose
You say trouble follows you
It's been like that since the day you began
We got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
I know very well you're bringing me down
I will follow, I will follow
For a little piece of heaven
I am ready, I am willing to drown
I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
We've done it a million times before
Yes, I'm up for it a million more
We're always taking trips downtown
Officer Brown's always coming around
Tapping on our windows, "Kids, come out
Ain't no way to live, let me show you how"
But we know we're not gonna change
Keep hustlin' every night and day
I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire
It's gonna backfire, baby
Gonna backfire, gonna backfire, baby
Done it a million times before
And I'll run for it a million moreWith your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies
I saw you creeping around the garden; what are you hiding?
I beg your pardon, don't tell me "nothing"
I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman
You were my knight and shining companion
To my surprise
My love's demise
Was his own greed
And lullabies
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies
I noticed you got hot in summer
You had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton
Your face was sunburned
You paced around like you'd been waiting
Waiting for something
Your world was burning and I stood watching
As I looked on
The flames grew high
You watched me frown
I said "goodbye"
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies
Is it me, was I wrong to have trusted you?
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?
It's amazing what women in love will do
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big liesBaby, you my Bugsy Malone and I'm your suicide blonde
You can be my film noir star I'm your Queen of Saigon

Trying to get away
You make it hard to leave
But it's easier for me to stay
I am so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the fighting, baby, we're
Not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
But boy, I'm so afraid
But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear
So I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid
We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between
A woman and her dream
And a man that never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came
So, baby, now I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
I-I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart, boy
I thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid
And it's not love, it's just the fear
That you've put down for all these years
But I'm leaving now
I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
Oh, I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid
Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I'm done being afraid
Oh, oh, ohBlue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room
You know you made my eyes burn
It was like, James Dean, for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know

Let's go
Tell me what bad boys do
I'm a bad girl, if you into that one too
My American Dream in jeans all blue
Keep it cool like crushed ice cubes
It's you felonious in a foreign coupe
In the blue range across my view
Better crush like my cunt too
Ain't 'nough said about his moves
A real tough one, sometimes two
Bet you fine about lifetime sunshine boo
Bananas and bow ties, whips and handcuffs
Tied down the club like living like gangsters
Both wanna die, love living in danger
Bodies all around, put it down like an
Anchor
Hardcore bottles
Try more than just anger
Passion like fever
Hot like Jamaica
Real rude boy, no problem for later
Money on his mind 'bout getting his paper
Truth be told he's locked down with his flamer
Really like his flavor
Wanna slow dance with the devil
Click-lick, the look of an angel
Took a small chance with a rebel now my flesh is amazing
Now we shooting them lasers and laughin' at haters
Gangster's not bred I make them
Gangster's not dead I raise 'em
Gangster's not dead
Gangster's not bred I make them
Gangster's not dead I raise 'em
Say you remember!
Say you remember!
Say you remember!I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you
'Member how we used to escape for the summer?
Fireworks and sparklers would light up the black skies
We'd hold on tight for our lives to each other
Hello, hello, where did you go?
We were two kids livin' life on the run
Like the American dream, baby
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun
We went too fast, too young
But I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you
Flowers in my hair, and your breath smelled like whiskey
Promise anywhere that I go, take you with me
Dancing on your feet, like a child, to the radio
Hello, hello, where did you go?
We were two kids living life on the run
Of the American dream, baby
Nothing to lose and we'd get messed up for fun
We went too fast, too young
But I won't cry my self to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
Now, you fall asleep with another
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you
Damn you
Every once in a lifetime
Dreams can come true
Now and then, when the stars shine
You meet somebody like you
And I won't cry myself to sleep like a sucker
I won't cry myself to sleep
If I do, I'll die
I pray your life is sweet, you fucker
Damn you
Oh, oh, damn you
Damn youYou know, in this town an artist really needs a lot of space when they're trying to create something special. A place to cultivate a world of their own, far away from the real world that's around them.
Luckily for me, I live right inside the middle of the 'H' of the Hollywood sign, and this is how I spent most of my nights: perched high above the chaos that swirls within the City of Angels below. Now don't get me wrong, I love to dip my toe into the muck and the mires of the city every now and then, especially on Tuesdays. But truthfully, when I'm in the middle of making a record - especially now, when the world is in the middle of such a tumultuous period - I find I really need to take the space for myself, far away from real life to consider what my contribution to the world should be in these dark times.
So each morning I have the luxury of asking myself, "What shall I cook up for the kids today? Something with a little spice? Something with a little bitterness but is ultimately sweet? Or shall I take the day off and turn down the fire, and just take a moment to send my love to them over the ether?" Because sometimes just being pure of heart, and having good intentions, and letting them be known is the most worthy contribution an artist can make.
So, even though these times can feel a little bit crazy, they're not so very different from what other generations have experienced at one time or another before. Amidst all the uncertainty, and as we transition out of one era into another one, there's no place I'd rather be than smack-dab in the middle of 'Hollyweird' making this record for you. Because you and the music, and this place are my love, my light, and my lust for life.You say you want your own life, well I do, too
You wanna lead me on?
Oh, well I'll show you
Come on girls, march it out

Take me for a ride boy
Don't leave me on the side boyOur kind of love
It was once in a lifetime
It couldn't last
It was doomed from the first time
And you
Were '50s cool
In blue suede shoes
But it was a cover for all of the trouble
You got into
I always fall for the wrong guy
Things that are bad always taste nice
That's what girls like me do, lose you
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is cryin'
Vicious in flames
Roland is dyin'
And in the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful
This kind of life
Wasn't meant for the good girl
Try as I might
In the end, it's a cruel world
And you
Are livin' proof
Sinatra aloof
But you were an actor who only went after
The ones who swooned
I always fall for the same type
Gangsters in Vegas on game night
That's what girls like me like, the limelight
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is cryin'
Marilyn's sad
Hendrix is lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful
If you should go before me, then know
That I always loved you
There's no one above you, babe
Don't tell me it's over
Don't tell me it's over
Hollywood's dead
Elvis is crying
Lennon, wake up
Cobain, stop lying there
In the light, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodbye, you're sickeningly beautiful
Say goodnight, you're so
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead
Hollywood's dead, yeah
CutYou know, sometimes I think God is playing a little game with me
Looking down from heaven, laughing, and trying to see how much I can take
Because the way things go, it's like a joke
Nobody's had more shots at the moon, and missed, than me
It's like I got my life stuck, stuck on rewind
Trying to make something of myself, life's got something else in mind
I'm fighting a losing game and I'm biding my time
You won't be my man, do I understand? No, stop
I don't want to hear another word about your 'Why not's'
I bought your bullshit all before, now you trying to sell me more, babe?
Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired
I'm walking down the streets, you wouldn't know what I was thinking
It's just another white girl day, hey ribbons in my hair, and I am sinking down
A double life, a sordid past, and I am drinking now
I want to be bad, you say you were glad to see me, shut up
I don't want to know another thing you think you know about me
I'm not who you think I am, smiling, but I ain't happy
Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired
Oh, I'm so far gone, I can't turn off my mind
It's like a ticking time bomb
Trying to kill me from inside
Haunting day and night
Is there no remedy for memory?
I've felt this way before I've known the depths of utter desperation
My boyfriend says I'm like an old movie star with loneliness as my occupation
I know that he's right but I don't care tonight
I want to be bad, I want to be bad, I can't stop
I keep running around the same town, knocking you down, I'm fucked
How can I get out when there's nowhere to go for miles around?
A man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tiredMaybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing the national anthem
Buy a white sweater for the last white day of the summer
Buy my purple wig for my mermaid video
Walk back to where I live in my motel on Neptune 
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
 Suede Tokyo
Or see Van Halen at their reunion show
Heavy metal hour on TV
Diamond Dave and Ray Lee
And you salute me, Miss America
Because I am, I am
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing you to sleep
God bless the universe, god bless the ocean
God bless you and god bless me
God bless you and god bless me
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it off
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say take it off, take it offOh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that
Life doesn’t always work out like you planned it
They say, "Make lemonade out of lemons,"
But I try and I just can’t understand it
All this trying for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask, Honey?
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesn’t matter now
The sun's setting on our love, bye, baby
Oh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that
Life doesn’t always work out like you planned it
They say, "Make lemonade out of lemons,"
But I try and I can’t understand it
All this begging for no good reason
Man makes plans and God laughs
Why do I even bother to ask, Honey?
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town
It doesn’t matter now
The sun's setting on our love, bye bye, baby
Oh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like that
It doesn’t matter what they say
Let’s go do it anyway
Cause you and I have an undying kind of love
You can be mine, I’ll be yours, c'mon baby
 
Oh, boy, you’re starry eyed
Lie back, baby, lie back
You’ve got heaven in your eyes
I like that, boy, I like thatThey say I'm wasting time, they say that I'm no good
Summer of my life, not doing what I should
Call me poison ivy 'cause I'm far from good
But pretty from afar, like a dark star
They think I'm dangerous, they think I'm really bad
I'm just making up for what I never had
Go out every night whenever I feel sad
All this drive-by love got me crazy like a drug
I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone
I wear my red lipstick, got my make-up on
Stumble into trouble, siren with a sad song
They all got girlfriends, but I’m the one that they want
Miss America, with the blue mascara on
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
Mommy's Mercedes or Billy's pickup truck
Come home late at night and baby picks me up
Tell him just drive on and d-don't ever stop
Don't take me home again, take me to a new land
I wear my red lipstick, got my coat and gun
I'm Miss America, now I'm gone, baby, gone
I wear my red lipstick, grab my coat and gun
Wonder if this is it, it's darkest before dawn
Sometimes I wanna give in, but I just have to go on
Miss America, now I’m gone, baby, gone
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I was born to live fast, die young
Leave a beautiful corpse, live my life on the run
I got my cash and my Louis Vuitton, diamonds and guns
Girls just wanna, just wanna have fun
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding 'round town drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
I spent my whole life driving in cars with boys
Riding around town, drinking in the white noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we know
I spent my whole life wasted in bars with boys
Playing rock 'n' roll, dancing in the loud noise
Used to talk about where we'd be and where we'd go
Now we know, baby, now we knowBaby has a broken heart
She can't belong to only one
Until another girl is found
I don't pay for anything
My cigarettes or diamonds rings
My feet don't even touch the ground
Chariots of gold, I ride with Jay-Z, Jared Leto
I'm a superpower, now they call me the tornado
I got roses in my hair, I belly dance, and do the tango
Sometimes I get lonely
Everybody told me no
No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on
Cleopatra used to rule
But she got nothing on me now
'Cause I'm the last girl on earth
I turn the television on
They only play my favorite song
Since I'm the last girl on Earth
Chariots of gold, I'm sitting, sipping cherry cola
Caesar said he'd fall in love with me if I was older
I own all of Mexico and I got my own roller-coaster
Sometimes I get lonely, millions can hold me now
No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on
I stay up late at night, try not to think about it
Pretend I'm happy, ruling all the world without love
I get so tired being on display somehow
Sometimes I get lonely, but millions all know me now
No one lives forever, but that's no reason to give up
Don't you wanna fall in love?
There's no such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it on
No such thing as heaven
And I'm the last girl on Earth
So baby, let's get it onTwenty of 'em wrapped up tight in silk
Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothing more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Jimmy pulls up in his blue Chevy Nova
I have been dyin' for him to come over
I’m in my party dress, he say, "You such a mess"
I am the New Jersey Dance Queen, he is the construction king
He knows that I be selling the body
My man the best 'cause he knows what’s up
He knows it’s a big bad world, knows that I’m a good girl
He understands the sale of self
Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Hundred dollar bill, hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
Nothin' more gorgeous than a hundred dollar bill
J. is a romantic roller coaster
He don’t do anything he supposed to
I like 'em tough and mean, Jim is the worst that I've ever seen
I am the trailer park darling, he is the one-time come-back king
He knows that I be lookin' to die
He says, baby, pay respect to the high
He knows it’s a big bad world, knows that I’m a good girl
He understands the sale of self
Cause cash comes quick when looks can kill)Chorus]

On the radio, dancin' in the night
Flowers in my hair, roses on the vine
You can be my guy, and I'm your baby, right?
My, my, apple of my eye
Looking really hot while I make ya cherry pie
Show me what you got, got a sparkle in your eye
You're so high
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy
Every way I move, every way you like
Pulling on my dress, holdin' me too tight
I know we'll probably lose, only got tonight
But I love the way we kiss, love the way we fight
My, my, lookin' really fly
Like the way the bling on your pinkie ring shine
You spin me really fast and you catch me in the sky
I'm so high

I want you boy, I want you boy

Baby boy you make me sigh-igh-igh-igh
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you boy, I want you boy
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught
Caught you boy, I caught you boy
Thunder in the air, trouble on my mind
Hold me in the dark, kiss it all behind
Baby don't be scared, come on honey, smile
Everything is fine now, everything is fine
My, my, talkin' all night
Laughin' really hard and it makes me wanna cry
I love our playing house, love our dressin'-up nights
Drinks on ice
I'm yours and I'm free and I'm fun
I'm wild as can be, and I want
I want you, I want you
I'm cool and I'm calm
A dangerous army of one and I caught

I caught you, I caught youYou can whistle for it
Baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While you're t-t-t-t-touching me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in that Chevrolet from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sunrise
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?
You said I'd never make it out outta here alive
At the rate I was going, I'd be lucky to die
I was born so bad, not naturally right
The brightest star on Hollywood and Vine
We're gonna party like we're running outta time
We're getting drunk and driving fast on cherry wine
Never do belong to anyone I find
Leaving everything I ever knew behind
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you lied
I learned how to make love from the movies
He found me waitressing at Ruby Tuesday's
He said I wanna buy you a classic white milkshake
I said I'll serve you up a special side of heartbreak
Special side of heartbreak
I was working down in the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
Lana Del Rey, how you get that way?
How you get that way?
I said "He loves my heart shaped sunglasses
He loves the heart shape my ass is
Cristal, crystal champagne glasses"
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
You told me this
Where is mine?
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Promised me this
Well, you liedEveryone from home

Sunset on a Saturday night
Having a drop-top 'bach ride, time of our lives
He's selling souls on the boulevard of broken dreams
And faded queens
Live young like we oughta die fast
Cause he's been breaking the law and he's not goin' back 
I love him violently all through the night

Cause you're my beautiful player

O is for the only one I wanted to stay
V is for my valiant Valium baby
E is for the X that we took with champagne
I don’t wanna leave, I just wanna breathe
I drive 'em crazy, baby girl, just being me
I’m not selfish, I can’t help it
I was playing the cards I was dealt-ed
The name Starz got a lot of love to give
Riding down Broke Dream Boulevard in the Benz
How you love that? I think too much
A thin line between insanity and true love
Hit me and it felt like kiss
Baby if it don't hurt, then I'll have to insist
We have just one life to live
But true love's more than he can give
Cause he’s my beautiful player
He’s my beautiful player baby

Cause he’s my beautiful player
He’s my beautiful player baby

You were afflicted by booze

Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding but you want more
"This is so like you," I said
Put yourself on back to bed
You're like crack to me, I don't want to leave
I'm watching you sleep, afraid you'll stop breathing
My baby's on his eighth life, darling
Staying with him till the morning
You're like crack to me, so fun I can't see
With your golden grill, your purple dream
My baby's on his eighth life, darling
Gonna watch him till the morning
I was addicted to you, didn't wanna blow it
You were a dick with your crew
Always on the road
You wanna touch life so hard
Why can't you give it a rest?
You're not that bright for a star
Burned yourself out, nothing left
Burned yourself out, nothing left
Styrofoam on the microphone
Can't give it up, can't go it alone
Flame-colored paradise for you, darling
But death doesn't come with a warning
Life is a velvet crowbar
Hitting you over the head
You're bleeding syrup amour
Bleeding to death
My baby's on his last life, darling
Gonna stay with him till morning
My baby's on his eighth life, darling
And death doesn't come with a warningI'm no longer a candle in the wind
We did it for fun, we did it for free
I did it for you, you did it for me
We did it for the right reasonsStanding on the rooftop
Just out of earshot
Looking at this gangster guy
Thinking he's a hot shot
Pouring me a big shot
Trying to get me drunk and high
He wishes to be seen with me
In his limousine
And he says we'll have a real good time
Well X-X-O but I want you to know
Every single night
In the lights
I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl
Trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight
It's alright
Let the fire ignite
I'm a party girl
And I'm just warning you
You don't get it
You just don't get it

 I won't fall in love
 I won't ever stop
 I'm partying all night
 I'm gonna make it pop
Kissing on your light yacht
Show me what you got got
Play a little rock n roll
On an island hotspot
Maybe we should dot dot dot
Do you think it's really mean
That I'm only on the scene
Cause I want a little danger boy?
Well X-X-O but I told you so
Every single night
In the lights

Because it’s your favorite color
A-A-A-A-A-And they call you Baby Boy
Because they like you, oh
The city is dangerous
I need your kiss to survive
The city is my dirtiest
I would advise
It’s nice, ice, baby
How much I’m liking you
Stone cold, baby
Rock, rock, baby, throw your money, come and pay me
Rock, rock, baby, throw your money, come and save me
Rock, rock, baby, you don't wanna come and save me
Rock, Baby BlueAll that's real to me is Marilyn and Jesus
Jumping off of bridges
Sparklers and streamers, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly
All that's real to me is Halloween and Jesus
Coney Island beaches
Chandeliers and seizures, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I can't be with the man I love
I can't be, if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him up
All that's real to me is trailer parks and beaches
Alabama breezes
Platinum and peaches, honey
I wanna fly, I wanna fly, I wanna fly
I can't be with the man I love
I can't be, if he treats me rough
I can't see him, I can't call him upBaby, say goodnight
Text me when you get home safely
Like you always did when we was first dating
You're sittin' in your office, dreamin' of a different life
You say you wanna make me smile and see my wild side
If we don't leave town now
We're never gonna get out of here alive
I'm walkin' home from school
My thoughts are drifting into space
Why don't we leave tonight
And take off to a different place?
Don't tell my daddy why
Gotta get on that plane and just fly
Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris , we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris
I wanna be that fantasy that you got on your mind
Flying across the sea to somewhere that they'll never find
We should go while we're young
'Cause one day, we will want to rewind
To our time in Paris
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
Paris , make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Why not go out every night?
Promise we won't say goodbye
Take me to Paris
Let's go there and never look back
Paris , we can be crazy like that
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris
Walking through the streets at dawn
We dance by empty carousels
Singin' at the Sacré-Cœur
And climbing up the Tour Eiffel
Under the stars, we are, we are
Dreaming 
You're such a naughty boy
Why you taking that Polaroid?
Put on a show you'll enjoy
Take me to Paris 
Take me to Yves Saint Laurent
It's Paris , make out in a dark restaurant
We'll dance until we die
Why not go out every night?
Promise we won't say goodbye
Take me to Paris
Baby, say goodnight
Text me when you get home safely
Like you always did when we was first datingHip-hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Hmm, hmm
Hmm, hmm
White lies and black beaches
Miles in between us
Is this love or lust or some game on repeat?
It's like making me crazy
Tell me, "Have patience"
Baby, I need this
White lines and black beaches
White lies and black beaches
And blood red sangrias
We traveled for weeks, just to escape your demons
But you've got your reasons
In making me crazy
But you've got your reasons
White lies and black beaches
I got a feeling in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins 
You can't escape my affection 
Wrap you up in my daisy chains 
Hip-hop in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, um 
Uh, her sophistication makes you wanna quit the bitch you datin'
Let's skip the games, let's quit the playin'
Boo, let's get acquainted 
Notifications sync in place even when we're on vacation 
I knew she'd notice like I missed the payment, dang it 
But bang it like my fingers 
She pray to God I made it 
But bankin' like my Franklins 
My neighbors stopped the hatin' 
What? 
Huh? 
Slide inside it 
Diddy Boppin'  
Milly Rockin' 
She just might become my lover for real 
I might fuck with her all summer for real 
They better not holla if I cuff her for real 
Wrap you up in my daisy chains 
Hip-hop in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, um 
Goin' bell how I feel, close the deal, pop a seal 
Take the whip, two pills on the lips on the real   
Truthfully between you and me I'm usually single
When it's hot outside this, I ride through any hood with the top out
Hop out
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Don't be a bummer 
Don't be a bummer 
Hip-hop in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe
(What? What? What? What? What? What? Yeah
What? What? What?)
High tops in the summer 
Don't be a bummer, babe 
Be my undercover lover, babe, um 
Don't be a bummer, babe
Ooh ohh, ooh ohh
Ooh ohh, ooh ohhThey all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground
Okay, lets go, 1234
No I'm vintage, no I don't care
No I'm not Kylie, no, you can't compare me to another one
There's no one else, I'm nobody, I'm just myself
It's not Fight Club, I'm a rare snowflake
But if I hear you bringing me down, calling me so fake
I will fight you , I will fight you 
Because in the end, there's only truth and God is gonna smite you
Besides that, I don't like you
I just wanna party boy, I don't wanna fight
But everybody knows that that's the way it is
Only players can survive
They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground
Rain, rain go away, now
Come again another day in the game now
Pre-Chorus
No I'm not retro, no I'm not fair
And yes, I like to re-record and dance in underwear
And its not Scarface cause I'mma live forever
And if I hear from anyone you're trying to get too clever
Then I will fight you, I will win, I will rise again, soar in the wind
It's my destiny, the way my life begins
So if you're in my way, I'll knock you down like kingpin
Ring around the rosie, oh
I don't wanna fall down
Keep my feet on the ground
Pocket full of nursery rhymes
I'm just biding my time
Biding my lines
I'm wearing the invisible crown
You can't see it yet
Touring up and tearing the town, a soul sinner, yes
Sometimes I rap too
I'm a white girl, but the world is my oyster
I'm a little pearl, yep
Ring around the rosie, oh
I don't wanna fall down
Keep my feet on the ground
Pocket full of nursery rhymes
I'm just biding my time
Biding my linesI remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were talking so brave and so sweet
Giving me head on the unmade bed
While the limousines wait in the street
But those were the reasons and that was New York
We were running for the money and the flesh
And that was called love for the workers in song
Probably still is for those of them left
Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
You got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
You were famous, your heart was a legend
You told me again you preferred handsome men
But for me you would make an exception
And clenching your fist for the ones like us
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty
You fixed yourself, you said, "Well, never mind
We are ugly, but we have the music."
Ah, but you got away, didn't you baby?
You just turned your back on the crowd
And you got away, I never once heard you say
I need you, I don't need you
I need you, I don't need you
And all of that jiving around
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best
I can't keep track of each fallen robin
I remember you well in the Chelsea Hotel
That's all, I don't even think of you that oftenWhere do we go from here?
This isn't where we intended to be
We had it all, you believed in me
I believed in you
Certainties disappear
What do we do for our dreams to survive?
How do we keep all our passions alive
As we used to do?
Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me
Why are you at my side?
How can I be any use to you now?
Give me a chance and I'll let you see how
Nothing has changed
Deep in my heart, I'm concealing
Things that I'm longing to say
Scared to confess what I'm feeling
Frightened you'll slip away
You must love me, you must love me
You must love meHe's my drugstore cowboy
Italian alloy, classical American
And I'm America's sweetheart
Chic, delicious, sweet tart
Sipping on my Diet Coke
Singin' in the trailer park
He like my jeans tight 
He likes me mean, right? 
He like my long hair, corset, heels high
We were born to kill, stripped for success
I'm his sweet mess
Do you love me? Yes, yes
Hell yes!

Baby's always wantin' more
Buyin' diamond jewelry
Take me to the Jersey Shore
He like my mink white 
We go out all night 
We're living off the grid
Shinin' in the crime light
We were born to kill, best of the best
The new wild west
Honey, put on that party dress
Hell yes!
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got
For the love of your life
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Let me be your dangerous girl
Me and my baby plannin' world domination
Together, takin' over our fair nation
'Cause we're born to kill, keepin' it fresh
Gold chain, white mesh
Fame is the name of the game
Yes, yes 
Baby, I'm a four alarm fire
And I'm what you desire
Like a siren in the night
Baby you's a man on the wire
Risking all that you got

My stars
The night time is almost ours
To wander through alleys
And look at the bars
Nighttime is almost ours
The headlights from passing cars
They illuminate my face and
Leave me the dark
The voice of Nirvana says
"Come as you are"
And I will
Nighttime is almost ours
The sway of the hips and arms
Will cradle you from afar
They swing till you're tired
And send you to Mars
Nighttime is almost oursI be BBM'in' you

We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs
Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
Cause we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
The last stand, let go of my hand
Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet again
You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll, sent us insane, I hope someday that we will meet againI'm a wild child, bright child, knocking at your door
You thought that you were done but now you want me even more
Dum dum
You want me even more
Dum dum
I'm a star child, big smile, living in L.A
I'm coming over, baby, you can't go to school today
Dum dum
Go to school today
Dum dum
I belong to a bygone era
Like the Scarlett O'Hara of the downtown scene
'Cause I just wanna dream, I just wanna drink
I'm a pop-blues singer, fam-bam zinger
Mansfield ringer from the Hollywood silver screen, silver screen
Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of heaven my way
You'll be forever changed
I'm a wild child, sky high, lying on your floor
I know I had a lot, but baby, what's a little more?
Dum dum
Want a little more
Dum dum
In my white mink, pink cigarettes from the store
We're making robberies from Tijuana to the shore
Dum dum
'Juana to the shore
Dum dum
I belong to a bygone era
Like the Bugsy Malone of the deep Sahara
'Cause I'm on the scene, yeah, I'm on the scene
I'm a bad jazz singer, giving you the finger
No matter what, you'll linger
'Cause you like me even when I'm mean, I'm the queen
Once you've had something, something so beautiful
You'll never be the same
Once you've had a taste of heaven my way
You'll be forever changedGramma said she'll leave the lights on for me

Love casinos, Indian reservations
But, baby, if you love me, take me to the gas station
Gas station
Look at you smoking in them neon lights
Under the thunder, yo, you look so nice

Take me to the gas station
Give me coffee, Utah love

Doesn't care, I'm always on my Blackberry
All the time, all the time, buyin' into every lie
I'm a flashy little lush, but he thinks I'm really fine
Notorious and wild, takes me where I'm gonna shine
Where the bad boys roll hard, dressin' like James Dean
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free
Baby, we are chancers on the scene
Glamour in the gutters, only so RT
Sick graffiti artists and tabloid queen
Mix it up, mix it up
Every 'do you've ever seen
We're acting really tough
Like the world belongs to us
Cause it does, yeah, it must
What we do creates the buzz
Where the bad boys blow smoke
Just like they're James Dean
And the it girls blow kisses
Just like Marilyn
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're gonna get free, free, free, free, free, free, free
Get free
Run for our lives
Break outta the chains
So cuttin' edge
Create our own games
DJs, rock stars, posers we are
The new politicians
The celebrity editions
And it's so pornographic, then it's tragic
Nothing magic makes us free
To be what we wanna be, wanna be
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion
About who we are and what we're gonna be
We're children of the bad revolution
And partying's the only solution
In our minds, there ain't any confusion

Come on, come on
I hope you remember me like this
Smokin' cigarettes in my sundress
Glamorous and gangster, oh yes
I hope I remember you just like that
Lookin' fresh to death in your ball cap
You say you'll tap it like a hi-hat
The future's looking bright as black tonight
You tell me that our love cannot endure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
Oh, I don't know a thing of this, I'm sure
There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathin' heavily
The way you're smilin', it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swingin' in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothin' but that t-t-television on
We're kissin' in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you
I wonder if you'll think of me like this
On your fire escape like a hot mess
You say, "You're beautiful but hopeless"
I promise that I'll think of you as the king
Quotin' Corleone like you're so mean
It's Cosa Nostra cause it's our thing
Lucy's in the sky with ice tonight
Heaven knows I've tried hard to find a cure
Baby, if it's wrong, I don't wanna be right
And if you ask again, I'll say I'm sure
There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathin' heavily
The way you're smilin', it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swingin' in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothin' but that t-t-television on
We're kissin' in the dark, in my diamonds
Put that MT-TV on, t-television heaven with you
Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, baby, you're a vision in blues
Stay up tonight, turn out the light
It feels so right, watching television with you
There's nowhere on this Earth I would rather be
Than in your bedroom breathin' heavily
The way you're smilin', it's so deadly
Honey, you are heavenly, t-television heaven with you
Swingin' in New York to Nirvana's song
With nothin' but that t-t-television on
We're kissin' in the dark, in my diamonds

Mississippi south
69 million stars
Birds are flying out of my mouth
Spirits creeping in my yard

Something's dancing me around
Putting crystals on our neck
Lifting my feet off
The ground
The ground

Baby, we could go back to the basics
Trailer park love, wearing them ASICS and gold
I can speak Spanish
You can sing for the neighbors
You've been pretty stupid ever since you got famous
Uh-oh, uh-oh, wrong side of the tracks, boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh, if only we'd go backward
'Cause nobody does it like you
I like the way that you move
That's why I never go through
With leaving you
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted, I know you'll see
Baby, we could go back to the basics 
We were best friends, crazy and shameless in love
You can mow the lawn for money
I can make you playlists
You bought me dimebags
Felt like we were famous
Uh-oh, uh-oh, best I ever had boy
Uh-oh, uh-oh, can you remember that, boy?
Nobody knew what we knew
We had it figured out, too
Us against the world just
Me and you !
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby
Back to the basics
When you're not wasted, I know you'll see
We could drive forever, my baby
We could leave it all and never look back
If you wanted heaven, baby
Sit back in my pink cadillac
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
Everybody's saying that you're no good for me
Your friends all swear that you've changed
But I still keep it O.G
This tune could be a reminder of how it all used to be
So shut up, and come on, sing our song
And let's go back to the basics
Let's go back to the basics, baby

You always buy me roses when I’m mad
Do you think I’ll forgive you just like that?
Did you forget who you were seeing, yeah?
I’m not letting you off easy, I’m still sad
I’m kissing you hard, you got my lipstick on your face
I stole your girlfriend’s keys, kicked her out of your place
Cause I want you more than I did before, -fore
I’m missing you hard, give you my softcore babyface
And then we start to fight, tumble down the staircase
And when we hit that floor, you want me even more, more
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright

Asking for forgiveness, unsexy
What happened to the man you used to be?
If you still want my love then work for me
You’re kissing me hard, you got my lipstick on your face
You show me what you got and put a girl in her place
If you want me more than you did before
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright
We had conversations, ain’t nothing said
This girl is crazy, I've done lost my head
"Her life is awesome", the doctor said
But my shit feel awful, this love is dead
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright
See I could see the pain
In her eyes, in her eyes
This love is dead
This love is deadI drop it like it's hot on the pole, on the pole

Makes you say "Oh no"
Cause you're the class president
Without Jackie O
And I'm singing happy birthday
Like Marilyn Monroe
This is not a school girl crush
This is not a puppy love,
It's the real thing
When you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby
This is not a school girl thing
What about the diamond ring? 
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it baby
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love
It's not puppy love
Puppy, puppy, puppy love
You make me wanna be
Like one of those girls
Calender pin-up queen and platinum curls
I'll do my summer pose
Golden sand between my toes
You can pack my favorite snacks of
Veuve Clicquot with Ho-Ho's
You're everybody's hero and you're hitting it home
While I'm singing for the soldiers like Marilyn Monroe
This is not a school girl crush
This is not a puppy love,
It's the real thing
When you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby
This is not a school girl thing
What about the diamond ring? 
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it baby, baby, baby
And if I call you on the telephone
I might overdose
Cause I'm strong, but I'm lonely like Marilyn Monroe
This is not a school girl crush
This is not a puppy love
It's the real thing
When you told me you loved me
What ever happened to hold m and trust me babe
This is not a school girl crush
This is not a puppy love,

When you told me you loved me
Promise I'll never see Arthur or Bobby, baby
This is not a school girl thing
What about the diamond ring? 
Everyone knows I'm like Jessica Rabbit
I'm your leading lady, I gotta have it baby

Puppy, puppy, puppy loveYou, you light my red fire babe
Hot white, and blue
And I, I think that you
I think you’re so cool, babe
Loving everything you do
You say we’re gonna run away
Put on your sundress, summer day
Flying around on the highway
Spin me ’round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and every day
Top down, gonna make a getaway, top down
Spin me ’round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
You found me when I had lost my way
Foot down, we’re going all the way, touchdown
Gonna make a getaway, top down
You know what I want
Take me to the K-Mart, pick me up pink lip gloss
How you get so hot?
You’re making me crazy
Hoping you’ll never stop
You say that we were meant to be
We’ll be together finally
Flying around and I’m finally free
We’re on our way
Why do I think too much?
You tell me not to worry
Because you’re the boss
And you, you got a real good plan
My trouble’s all over now
Because you’re my man
You don’t know what you’ve done to me
You’re heavier than heavenly
Life on the run has set me free, me free now
We’re on our way...
You tell me not to worry
Because you’re the bossDisco

You think I'm pretty and I like the way you talk
You like my music and I like the way you walk
So, I think we're gonna get along
I like the way you wear your sweater off your shoulder
The way your hair comes down and makes you look older
How are you getting so handsome, my boy?
Pretty baby
Pretty baby
The way your face is shaped, I wonder if you know
The way you stand up and your silhouette glows

Then I heard the sirens
Interrupt the silence

To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime?
Is this what you wished
To commit a crime, commit a crime, commit a crime?
You was a nice guy, really bright
Making money's hard to do right
Guilty was his plight

To leave me behind, me behind, me behind?

Get drunkI guess it’s symptomatic of a slight infatuation
Stalkin' you has sorta become like my occupation
I used to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions
Met my local rock star now I’m havin' visions
I fell for you, you like me too
Let’s get it on, check one, two
I fell for you, you want me too
Let’s get it on
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
I’m makin' out with you while you’re singin' your song
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
You’re playing your guitar and it’s turnin' me on
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it’s wrong, I don’t wanna be right
I gets so systematic in this kind of situation
I need it, have to have it, t-take over, domination
Used to be so simple, never wantin’ and never wishin’
Now I’m hooked on fame and I’m a girl on a mission
I fall for you, it’s all for you
Let’s get it on, check one, two
I fall for you, it’s all for you
Let’s get it on
Is it wrong?

If it’s wrong, I don’t wanna be right
A funny little thing about love is that you’re blind all the time
And even when you think you had enough
You’re wanting more, it isn’t right but
You can’t stop
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
You got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your ca-ca-ca-car-r-r
Is it wrong?
Is it wrong?
If it’s wrong I don’t wanna be rightWhat cruel world is this, nectar of the gods?
Heroin gold in my veins and you in my thoughts
I'm on the freeway, racing at a million
And I just can't stop
I call you up twice, hang up the phone
Call again, I wanna talk
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy, like you never knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy, like the color blue, blue, mm
What sweet world is this, honey on the vine?
School kid dreams came true, then passed in the night
I used to dream about people like you, now I don't know why
I used to sing about people like you, now I just get high
And get wild on you, baby
I get wild and fucking crazy, like you never knew, knew, knew
I get wild on you, baby

I don't wanna know I'm wrong
I don't wanna know I'm wrong for youWe’re sippin' cocktails, lookin' down upon the riot
You whisper “Baby, love the way you look tonight
I wanna save you, save you from the world outside."
I know it seems you’re all I wanted and much more
But then, to tell the truth, I’ve been through this before
They say “I’ll save you, save you”, but they never do
I think you know I want to believe you
But in my heart, I know that I’ll leave you
It’s sort of sad how instincts deceive you, or does it please you?
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you've done makes me wanna run, run
I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walkin' out the door but I already miss you
Thinkin' about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I make the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're callin', it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
Well back in high school, in the yard, we used to fight
But you would sneak in through my window every night
“I wanna take you, take you to the world outside”
Well, I assume it’s what I wanted at the time **
But your eyes were like a constant warning sign **
“I wanna take you, take you” and I didn’t mind
And even then I didn’t believe you **
You had a smile so easy to see through
I know a little part of me will always need you **
Try to reach you, try to please you **
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you done makes me wanna run, run
I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walkin' out the door but I already miss you
Thinkin' about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I make the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're callin', it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I know, I know, I know, we aren't good together
I can’t let go, I’m sure that we should be forever
I look around, there’s no one above you
I think you know that I’ll always love you
And baby, I’m bad too, it’s not just you
But I can’t wait forever to trust you
Everything you say makes me wanna stay
But everything you’ve done makes me wanna run, run
I made the decision that I can’t be with you
Walkin' out the door but I already miss you
Thinkin' about how I used to kiss you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterflies
I make the decision that I’m too good for you
Then I see you're callin', it’s hard to ignore you
Try to be strong, but babe, I adore you
I-I’m getting butterflies, I-I’m getting butterfliesPalm trees in black and white
Last thing I saw before I died
Palm trees in black and white
Was the last thing I saw before I died
Right line, right man
Right mixture of cocaine and heroin

Palm trees in black and white
You are a junkie on your window smiling wide
Palm trees in black and white
Lean forward and you close your eyes

You take my whole world, baby, and twist it to the right

You know I like ‘em bad, boy
Wrong side of the track, boy, oh
You know I like ‘em bad boy, like you
I like a man with kick, yeah
So come around and hit me up
No other man can lick me like you
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I’m not gonna do it, baby 
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only show a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
I see my best friends kissing
Touching all the time
But I don’t need no jet to write it in the sky
I see it in his eyes, I’m his cherry pie
You know I like ‘em bad, boy
They think you make me sad, boy, no
The best I ever had, boy, it's you
I want a man that's hot, yeah
To come around and rock me, yeah
No one can dirty talk me
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I’m not gonna do it, baby 
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Everybody's at the park tonight
Everybody's at the shore
Everybody's on the street tonight
What the hell would we do that for?
Everybody's at the park tonight
But we got fireworks galore, behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
Tell me I should leave nearly every day
I’m not gonna do it, baby 
Everybody’s saying you’re no good for me
But they don’t see the dirty stuff you do to me
You only shout a little but you give me more
Behind, behind, behind
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doors
Behind closed doorsYou're like a fake diamond
Sparklin' when the lights are on
But when the nighttime comes
And all the lights go off
You turn off with them
You're like an old film reel
Kissing me when the crowd can watch
But when the velvet falls
And the projector coughs
I can be sure you're gone
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
You're like a fake diamond
Sparkling in the moon and sun
You shine like the only one
But when the darkness comes
Baby, you're on the run
You're like my ex-boyfriend
Kissin' me when the camera's on
I'm candy for your arm
Look like a debutante
But I'm not what you want
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
Baby I can hold you tight
Let me love you right
In the middle of the night
I don't wanna fight
Give it to me
Sing it to me
Show me the light
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey
I just want you to want me
Want you to want me
I'm like a child who belongs to nobody
So I wear you like my clothes
Hold you close to my body
Because you hurt so good
But you feel so bad honey

What cruel world is this? Nectar of the gods
Heroin gold in my veins, you in my thoughts
I'm on the freeway racing at a million
And I just can’t stop
I call you up twice, hang up the phone
Call again, I wanna talk
I get wild on you baby
I get wild and fucking crazy like you never knew
Knew, knew, knew

Californ-I-A, homeland of the gods
Once I found my way, but now I'm lostIt's like a Hollywood movie
The black and white waves sparkling truly
My man likes to watch me while I watch TV
While he's t-t-touching me
I remember vintage green wallpaper
Your criminal arms, I couldn't feel safer
King Creole daddy, chasing that paper
I l-l-love you
Baby you'll never be old in my eyes
With your golden grill true love never dies
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride
I will ride
I will ride
Baby you know mama never had much money
But I plan on using this face to pay, honey
Give me give me give me give
You're so funny, love you 'til I die
Who's living life like it's the Belvedere
Swinging all night on the crystal chandelier
Bring that velvet Elvis over here
Come on, baby you never know 'til you try
Baby you never live 'til you die
Baby you never love 'til you're mine
C'mon you're mine, you're mine, you're minePlatinum and vale acrylics
Skim the paper for the critics
Baby's breathing Elvis lyrics
On the copper bar
Late in motel lounges singing
Spotlight on the band is swinging
Chateau Marmont memories fading
Hope is very far
Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace catching
Baby, on the chandelier
Sweeping scents and blue hydrangea
Summer hail and summer stranger
Baby, he's in constant danger
Help is very far
You look like a Florida native
"Are you?" I said, at the rate of
Slow molasses from the state of
Vermont with a Southern drawl
Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier
He said he'd come to welcome, warn me
Just your diamond to adorn me
Come to be and see the one and only
For my final year
Well, thank you
Elvis, where are you when I need you most?
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost
Pick me up and make a toast
Champagne in the air
Tipping back his head, relaxing
"Thank you very much" and I'm laughing
All my chantilly lace is catching
On the chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
It's catching on that chandelier
Where are you when I need you most?Ah, Don't fuck with me
I told you 
I told you 
I told you 
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
I told you 
Don't fuck with me
I told you 
Don't fuck with me 
I told you 
Don't fuck with me 
Don't fuck with me 
"Fuck you" attitude
You know what I wanna do
Light it up red, white and blue
Do I look high to you?
That's because I am
That's because I am
Do you know what I had to do
To get here, man!?
No no, you don't don't
Cause you're not a gangsta 
No no, you don't don't 
Cause you're not a gangsta
Like I am
Scarface, sacrifice
Sold my soul to make it nice
It was worth it, paid the price
Life is death when blow is life
But me and my crew
We know what we like
We know how to roll
Will we ever stop?, No!
Don't fuck with me
Don't fuck with me
You're not a gangsta

Fuck!I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight
Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
Kiss me hard before you go

It's a party, it's a party, it's a party, c-c-come onJerry says that anytime
I think I have a good idea
That I should do the opposite
Of whatever it is I feel
And that’s because I have a bad mind
And I have gold in my veins
But he says I got the purest heart
That he’s ever seen
What'd God give me a brain for?
He won’t help me use it
What'd God give me a plan for
If he won’t help me do it?
You’re gonna love me
I’m gonna make you
You’re gonna love me
I’m gonna make you
Well I can tell that you’re the type
To never trust a beauty queen
But I was never voted for nothing
And high school never meaned
Anything to anybody
Never ever gave myself away
But even when I’m funny
You think I’m acting, so I say
What'd God give me a brain for
If he won’t let me use it?
What’d God give me a plan for?
He never helps me do it
You’re gonna love me
I’m gonna make you
You’re gonna love me
I’m gonna make you
You say that you don’t want to be hypnotized
But baby I, I don’t want to hypnotize you
There’s nothing from you that I want to take
I just want to be like you
Please
Jim, I'mma dedicate this whole album to you
You told me to get my way
That’s exactly what I’m gonna do
I’m going to strike out, right now
I’m striking out right now with this song
But I can’t help myself;
I can’t do right for long
You know that
What God give me a brain for?
He knows that I can't use it
I don't know why he'd give me a plan for
He never lets me do it
You’re gonna love me
I’m gonna make you
You’re gonna love me
I’m gonna make youWell, there is something about watching a crime
It makes me want to go out and make it all mine
It's something about seeing you fight
It makes me want to go out tonight
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, it's true
There's something about seeing him die
That puts it all into perspective and I
Want to stay home, be left alone
Someone make my mind up so I don't have to decide
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
To fall into
Yeah, I do
There's some reason why I can't sit still
Every waking moment I feel so unfulfilled
I try to lie down, but I don't know how
Baby, when I'm dreaming, it feels less like I am sleeping
Oh, my god
I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
There's a fear I have of feeling real bad
I'm fine now, if I find out that I'm not I'll be sad
I try to quiet the thoughts in the night
Oh, they got me thinking, I'd be happier just drinking
It's not true
And I got a bad disease
I got a bad disease
It's got me down
On my knees
Oh, no
I got a bad disease
Will no one help me please?
Not even you?Oh, baby, when you call me, I come to
From dreams I'll wake, and I'm waiting for you
Oh, baby, when you call me, I come to
I jump through hula hoops of fire just to get to you
You're making me crazy, oh, little baby
Shut your complaining, aye-aye-aye-aye
You make me so angry, someone should pay me
Why don't you get the sty-y-y-yle?
Make me smile
Life's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance
Oh, honey, when you call me, I want to
Stay on the telephone for hours just to get you home
Oh, sugar, when you call me after school
I see your smile and I could run a methampheta-mile
I'll never forget it, oh, you'll regret it
Nowhere to kiss it, aye-aye-aye-aye
Take it or leave it, better believe it
You'll never see why-y-y-y
Say goodbye
Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance
New kind of porno
One that has yet been born, oh
Loving you's like loving a hurricane, I'm tired of
All the mess you make, all the hearts you break
Loving you's like loving a dirty bomb, you're blowing up
All the cash I'm paid, all the love we made
Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
Love's been killing me, but I willingly go
You're kidding me, why keep leading me on?
Keep killing me, won't stop stealing my heart
Keep killing me, won't stop bleeding my soul
You know I go the distance
The path of least resistance
Your problem with commitment is
The bane of my existence
True love, it comes once
You messed it up, you stupid...I say, "Hey, Jimmy Gnecco
I like the way your name echo
You are so fine."

Blue 50's queen, blue oyster cove
For the big dream, why don't we go
To Coney Island?
When the hour numb the guy lies on
The record spins, blue 50's song
The veranda looks ocean on
Neon palms sway
What's happening? Where did we go?
The Jersey Shore was long ago
As with our hopes and ocean grove
And so I bid you farewellEverybody said that it wasn’t love
I was dumb
I was getting high on your sugar rush
For too long
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re posting pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, what the hell?
We were in heaven then we fell
I believed you, said I’d never leave you
I-
I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Livin' with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re postin' pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, havin' fun, havin' fun
Everybody said: “Careful of that guy”
Baby couldn’t stop, it was suicide
Headed for a cliff, eyes open wide
You were feignin' love by holdin' tight
But I need you, don’t want to, but need to
I-
I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Livin' with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re postin' pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, havin' fun, havin' fun
You been messin' around with my beating heart
You should be ashamed
Boy, you never loved me from the start
Such a wicked game
I told you I needed somebody
I never used you for love or for money, boy
I feel like I can’t trust nobody
Beat on my heart and you left it all bloody, now
I thought that you loved me, I was wrong
You took all my money and you went off on the run
Livin' with my best friend in the sun, in the sun
You told me that we could have it all
Now you’re postin' pictures on your wall
Of you and her together, havin' fun, havin' funDown on the West Coast, they got a sayin'
"If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'"
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West Coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the music, you for the music
It's true, it's true
I push it hard, you pull away, I'm feelin' hotter than fire
I'm feeling like there's no one else, brings me higher and higher
Te deseo, cariño, boy it's you I desire
Your love, your love, your love
I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love 
Down on the West Coast, they got their icons
Their silver starlets, their Queens of Saigons
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
You pull me close, I push away... I'm feeling hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet
I'm alive, I'm a lush
Hold me close you say, hush baby hush
I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I can see my baby swingin'
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh baby, Ooh baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swayin'
He's crazy y Cubano como yo, my love
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move baby, move baby, I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in loveI was loungin' at the Chateau Marmont
Glimmerin' by the swimmin' pool
My man walked in like a slow-motion movie
I said, "You're so cool"
I heard a man screamin', "Lights, camera, action!"
I c-c-can't remember what happened
I overdose, you throw me over your shoulder
I was dyin', you were screamin'

If you’re done with the dance, you should let me go
Baby you said it all
There’s nothing you can say to break my fallYou thought i was rich
And i am but not how you think
I live in a tudor house
Under the freeway in Mar Vista by the beach
when you call i take my phone outside to the picnic table
that i bought from the Rose Bowl
and i listen to the rushing cars above
and i think about the last time you visited me
the last time we made love
how the noise got louder and louder during rush hour
and it felt like the ocean was the sky
and that i was flying because you were two feet taller than me
until you took me in your arms
and i could touch the stars
and they all fell down around my head
and i became and angel
and you put me to bed
happy
People think that i'm rich and i am but not how they think
i have a truck with a gold key chain in the ignition
and on the back it says: happy joyous and free
happy
and when i drive
i think about the last time my friends were driving with me
how the radio was so loud that we couldn't hear the words
so we became the music
happy
They write that i'm rich and i am but not how they think
i have a safe i call the boyfriend box
and in it every saved receipt
every movie theater ticket just to remind me
of all the things i've loved and lost and love again
unconditionally
Happy
You joke that i'm rich and i am but not how you think
i live in a tudor house under the freeway
off of Rose Avenue 12 blocks from the beach
and when you call i put your sweater on
and put you on speaker
and chat for hours underneath the trees
and think about the last time you were here lying next to me
how the noise from the cars got louder and louder
during rush hour
until it sounded like a river or a stream
and it felt like we were swimming
but it wasn't just a dream
we were just
happyHawaiian tropic, dark, and a bottle of jack in the Cadillac
As I drive down the highway
You aren't coming back and I know that now
So I let the wind hit me in my face
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
Your red Hawaiian shirt and your hair jet black
Hanging 'round with your friends by the track
Baby, you can't come back from being that bad
Just to sit at home, pledge allegiance to the flag
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone
Copacabana, yes in my party dress
I’m shimmering in love on that crystal meth
A Coca Cola kid, roller coaster child
You my everything, give me that baby doll smile
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, where is mine?
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, were you lyin'?
And the velvet Elvis and the rosaries
And your white Corvette under willow trees
You the one for me, my one true king
Every man gets his wish, every man gets his wish
You told me this, now you're gone
I remember party dresses
I remember party dresses
Every man gets his wish
Every man gets his wish
But sometimes it comes too lateAll dressed up, with nowhere to go
That's the story of the girl you know
Me
I'm all smiles but inside I frown
Cause I've seen you walkin' around with Betty Lou
Didn't I tell you what I heard about her?
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what them other girls do
You'll date anyone, you'll date anyone
Are they more fun than me, baby?
I'm smiling, the New Jersey queen
And you're the best thing I ever seen
So won't you pull up your white corvette
Jimmy, let me get a better look at your face
I know it ain't doing
But I know what you like
So come on inside and I'll fix you ice-cream
A little banana split for you, Jim
You're so fine, you're like silk la roux
Guess that's why you keep slipping through my fingers
You're the state's number one
Everybody knows it
You smile all the time
Cause how can you not show it
When even you know
That you're so
To die for, to die for
What do I need to get high for?
When I have you
When I have you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you
It don't matter to you what those other girls done
I'm gonna prove to you
I'm gonna prove to you
You'll never find nobody more fun
Dah, dah, dah
More funEvery time you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
There's someone I have never talked about
I know that we'd both be dead if you found out
Every time you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something I have been withholding
I'm not like every other girl
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, Yoha, yoho, Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
So if you begin to think that my light might be supernatural
I'd have to say "You're right, you're right, mon Cher, it is."
I come from a place that your mind cannot even imagine
Where we sing "Maha, mahaha, mahaha, maha."
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, Yoha, yoho, Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, Yoha, yoho
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
You are the man of my dreams that I've waited for
Where we sing "Maha, oh maha, oh maha, maha."
I give my loving, I'm your devoted
I give my loving, I'm your devoted
Maha, maha, maha, maha, Maha, maha, mahaChorus: Lana Del Rey
Sweet serial killer
Do it for the thrill of the rush
Love you just a little too much, much
Verse 1: Malcolm Anthony 
Murder me love, damn girl
I was supposed to be your, man girl
I thought we had, plans girl
I guess that all changed
Been sucking on my blood
Cuz I forgot to check for fangs
She a monster, cold hearted
The female dexter, who's next up?
No I'm not the last to get the
Wrath or the pressure
It seems its all fate
But when you livin in her thrill
You might die during the chase
She's a killer!You're hot for God, but we all got a hunch that
Maybe you've gone astray
Control yourself, but it's so hard
When you can look so good on Sunday
I know he knows that I knew what he's thinking
I know he knows
I know he knows that what he's doing is wrong
But I just tell him "Go on, sing a sad song."
My baby has an eye for pretty things, pretty things
He thinks that little girls are butterflies and clips their wings
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Puts them on a roller coaster, lures them in with Coca-Cola!

Secret that you cannot betray

But baby boy, your secret is safe
I know he know that I knew what he's thinking
I know he know
I know he know that what he's teaching is wrong
But, honey, this preacher's song has got me too far gone
My baby has an eye for girls who sing, girls who sing
He's lucky I'm the type, that's his thing, that's his thing
Sicko, psycho, sicko, but he's my beau
Dresses up in rings and rollers, poses as a Holy Roller!

His butterflies are in a golden cage, safe and bound

If they don't think we're good together, baby just forget 'em
When he's bad, he's bad
But when he's good, no one's better
Cause we're a match made in Heaven
And this kind of love's forever

I'm a strong babydoll but I want you aroundMoney is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?
I'm the national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on", he said "Yes, yes, yes..."
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all 
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all 
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye
Money is the reason we exist
Eveybody knows it, it's a fact kiss, kiss
I sing the national anthem
While I'm standing over your body, hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He says to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real
Don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all 
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all 
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress
I'm the national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon
He says to be cool and I know he means it
He's loving my look
And I'm loving all his strategic ways
I said "do you think you'll kill for me one day?"
And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all 
I wanna sing, wanna swing on his stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy
Yeah, I want it all 
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, bye
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
I'm your national anthem, national anthem
I'm your national anthem, national anthemDrop me off at the Copacabana
You're my one true love, aren't you man, ah?
I'm your little Super 8 movie
You know I'm in love with ya truly, yeah
So when, baby, if you
Don't get down 
Don't get down
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
Its finally time to make a safe get away
I could not be happier
Drop me off, Santo Casino
I got an idea, why don't we go to Mexico?
Like we said we would, and you, don’t want, want to
But I think, I think it'd be good for you, Billy
You never want to do nothing anymore and I
Remember the days when you used to sway and you'd
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
It's finally time to make a safe get away
I love you, baby
What happened to us? Me and you?
I was funny once and you were funny, too
One day, we woke up and I found that we had grew
And only I wasn't me, I had come out blue
And you, I don't know what to make of you
You're not a color, you're more of a shape
Of your former self, like they say, babe
I remember the days when you'd
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
I love you more with each and everyday
And I'll continue always to keep that way
Yellow, red or blue
Don't matter to me if it don't matter to you
We'll just keep on trucking and see what we do and
I remember every way that you love me, baby
Spin me 'round, kiss me in your Chevrolet
Top down, howlin' "Vegas" all the way
We almost had it all, didn't we, baby?So, I heard you wanna go to Rio, baby
Yes, I seen page six lately, ah
I told you both them broads was crazy
Hackin' in your phone and shit
Diamonds and pearls, your little girl
She got the best, sparklin' like a Hollywood movie, ah-ah-ah
If you got the cash, lock it down tight
I got the looks, you got my heart right
And you love me, 'cause I'm just like neon
Lightin' up your night
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothin' from you
Just to be like you, my king
I thought that you wanted a real girl, baby
You lured me in with all your gold
Catch and release, and you're so cold
Are you crazy?
You didn't know what kinda fish you caught
'Cause I am a shark, beware of my bark
I'll eat you up like the center of a tootsie pop
'Cause we were a match in heaven, high
Only one catch, Frank was the boss, right?
And it's so sad, 'cause the only way
That you know how to love is fight
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
I didn't want nothin' from you
Just to be like you, my king
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
Give it to me, give it to me, everything
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a string
You know how I like my world on a stringSmile though you heart is aching
Smile even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile through your fears and sorrows
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll see the sun come shining through
If you just smilePin up girls at the roller derby
Take me down to Newark, New Jersey
American flags
Blue, blue streamers
Everybody's laughing
The crowd is cheering
Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world
Not of this world
Dance at night back in Alabama
Christmas lights on my teal green trailer
American flags
Blue, blue streamers
All the men are watching
The crowd is screaming
Baby, I've become someone
Baby, I've become
Baby, I've become someone
Not of this world

When you know it's not true
I know you're seeing her
But you can still see me, too
If you wanted to, baby
I know they say I'm cheap
And you're two-timing me
That's what you get
We're in the 21st century
So much for chivalry
I know you'll come to me
I have a way with men like you, baby
You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your little baby come, oh, come to you
When you gonna let me drive you crazy like nobody do
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?
I did the Playboy dip that made us famous
And you was watching there with your crew
I should have known just by the circumstances and who
I was meeting you through
That you were bad news
I know that's not the way
Most people meet but, hey
We're living in the fast lane
Post-modern day
You're not sure you can change
Or get out of the game
You're not the only one
I've heard say, "Maybe"
You're all I wanted, boy, I never needed anybody else
Your logic's flawed and you've been telling lies to yourself
When you gonna let your baby tie you up and drive you crazy?
You're all I needed boy, I never needed anybody else
I know you're scared to see me only and nobody else
When you gonna love your baby?
When you gonna love your baby?Ooh-Ooh baby, can't you hear our favorite song?
Ooh-Ooh baby, make me wait a bit too long
I don't ever want to stop, show me everything you got
I've done this before, and I should know better
Ooh-Ooh baby, what planet are you on?
What ya waiting for? What ya waiting for?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?
Did you say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Should be taking off your pants for me
Are you ready for me, finally?
Are you ready now?
Ooh-Ooh baby, look at all your high-brow friends
Ooh-Ooh baby thinkin' I don't understand
Cuz I'm drinkin' diet coke a lot, sucking on my lollipops
I know that I'm not that grown up, but no one's better
Ooh-Ooh baby, when you gonna be my man?
What ya waitin' for? What ya waitin' for?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Say you wanna put your hands on me?
Did you say that there's a chance for me?

Did you say you wanna dance with me?
Wanna put your hands on me?
Say that there's a chance for me?
Are you ready now?
Did you say you wanna dance with me?

Should be taking off your pants for me
Are you ready for me finally?
Are you ready now? Are you ready now?Even my best days without you
Were nothing in comparison to my worst days
Once I had found you
Once I had you
I had everything
I had everything
I had everything
Please don't leave
It's all happening
When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
I asked you beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smiling in your sleep
You would talk to me, in my wildest dreams
I never knew I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like like
I'd find somebody like you
Like you
Like you
When I was sleeping without you
Haunted by the baddest dreams
At last you’re beside me
I have you, yes I have you
Smiling in your sleep
Pillow talk to me
In my wildest dreams
I never knew I find somebody like you
Like you
Like like
I find somebody like you
Like you
Like youI think we're losing what we used to have, you know
You loved me better one year ago, oh
Don't let me down, don't let me down so low
But I won't be ashamed if you leave me
I won't be all that mad if you go
'Cause I know, yes I know
You always spending all that stupid time
With your band on the road
But your band is all the rage
So I've been told
But you can still come home
You can still come home when you want
And I won't be ashamed to take you back in
Won't be ashamed to put a kiss on your lips
'Cause I know, I know
Boy, don't call me up quickly on the phone
It's been five nights since I heard the tone of your voice
You act like everything's alright
But we both know, we both know that it's not
And it's far from ever being good again
Darlin', I'm gonna love you forever
If you come back, I'll take you back in baby
Back in, baby, back in, back in
I love you more than I will even know
You're so special
I guess that's why you got it where you go
But when you get real big, baby
Remember that little old cowgirl
Waiting for you back in that Red River Valley
Waiting back in that Tallahassee
I love youPerfect petals punctuate the fabrics yellow blue
silver platters with strawberries strewn across the room
In Zimmerman with sandals on one summer dress to choose
Three girls
eyes rolled
loud laughter
dust specs lit by afternoon
My life is sweet like lemonade now there's no bitter fruit
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
no thought of you
My thoughts have changed
my voice is higher
now i'm over u
No flickering in my head movies
projected in Bellevue
Because I captured the mood of my wish fulfilled
and sailed to Xanadu
The grief that came in waves that rolled I navigated through
The fire from my wish as wind to future-trip to Malibu
now everything I have is perfect
nothing hard to do
just perfect florals
green embroidered chairs
one dress to chooseGreen are the colour of the eyes of the man I love
He's hard to take and hot to touch
And green is the color of the sea in the early month
Of mid-July, te amo much
You get so mad when I complain
You think I'm crazy but
I hear them talk they say my name
They're fucking tired of
All these beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful people and god knows I've got them
She wants to die 
And she should fucking try 
Red is the color of your mouth when you drink rum punch
You like July and yellow sun
And red are the color of your eyes when drink too much
You pack your place, you pack a punch
You get so tired, tell me to stop
I'm ruining our love
When I walk by, I hear them talk
They're fucking tired of
All these beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful people and god knows I've got them
She wants to die 
And she should fucking try 
Oh, oh, oh
She wants to die 
And she should fucking try 
All these beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful people and god knows I've got them
Beautiful people with beautiful problems 
Beautiful people with beautiful problemsDon't be bad, don't be bad
Don't be bad, babe
Don't be bad, don't be bad, babe
Haha!

Mais vous, le voulez-vous ?

When you went away
I was sad and gray
You were like sunshine
Brightening up my day
Je voudrais you to stay
And I'm not quiting
I'm not waiting
I was born to play
Moi je joue 
Moi, je joue à joue contre joue 
Je veux jouer à joue contre vous

I'm your vulgar darling
In the swimming pool
Glimmering, you say
That you're nobody's fool
I know that, babe
I know that
But it doesn't mean
You can't come in
And get cool
Get cool, get cool 
Get cool, oh-oh, ah 
Get, get cool, cool!
MmmYou'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you
And anywhere you go, I will follow
Even if it's only in spirit, baby
But honey you should go by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy
Leave while you still can
Before I take you down, take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now, get out now
You'll see me hanging around on the edges of town
I could be bad for you
And honey don't think about chasing this girl around
I could be bad for you
And anywhere you go, I will follow
Even if it's only in spirit, baby
But honey you should go by tomorrow
I predict that shit's gonna get real crazy
Leave while you still can
Before I take you down, take you down
Boy there's still a chance
For you to get out now, get out nowI hope you remember me like this
Dancing in the stars in my sundress
I was just a dreamer, no stress
And battles lines became paradise next to you
You been working hard 9 to 5 and
I'm doing my part in tryin'
Just to make you smile and get happy
Like daddy used to say to me
"When you're young and free
Stop and think of me"
Staying together is heaven when you look so good
And you taste so sweet
Never let me go
Boy hang on to me
Staying together forever it's heaven when you taste so sweet
When you're young and freeYou have a right to live your life
Like no one else does, like no one else might
If you have visions, come on and live them out
All you need is some peace while you are here
Just let go until you are home, dear
I had a dream when I was young
I dreamt our lives were going to be fun
We were always waiting to live
All you need is some peace while you are here
Just let go of it all, dear
You have a choice to hear the noise
Or hear the sweet sound of your sweet voice
I know I've heard it, I heard it in my sleep
All you need is some peace while you are here
Just let go, don't say no, dear
Wake up each night at the same time
Roll up the blind and look outside
And in the orange light, the fog is rising
This is life, this tonight, peace in the quiet
Happiness is the skyYou know it & I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far
Don't say hello
It's already time to go
Oh the wind is carrying me home
Me home me home again
Well you know it & I know it
I'm gonna be a star
You won't, you won't get me very far
You saw life back in the countryside
Ahhh ahh ahh
Oh my soul rise up & go beyond, beyond
To what you knowMet you in front of a diner and you had blue hair
You were so nice
You were from L.A. but you were all there
You were all right
So many people say that they have it together
But I think you're a nice guy
And I think we could be birds of a feather
Met you in front of a diner and you were so sweet
Made my heart beat, oh, my, my, my, my, my
I met you with your mother and she had green shoes
She was so cool, it was fine, fine, fine, fine, fine
You were sorting pictures and you gave me one
Of a nun who was playing the drums
She was crazy, her name was Katie
I think you're so fun
You don't think I'm that strange, you're so weird
That's cause you're so queer
But who's not these days?
You wear purple socks and you still like Purple Haze
So many people think that you have it together
But they don't see you crying in the shower
Bet I can make you better
Cause you make me better
Yeah, you make me better
Yeah, you make me betterCarry me up them stairs with my white socks on
And my pretty song
You like my blue nail polish
"What is all this?" you said of the mess upstairs
"Don't be scared."
Daddy dearest, you know how I like to take trips
Pops first stops at the K-Mart, buy me my peach lip gloss
Cigarettes and lollipops for our trip across the USA
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949
Carry me up the stairs with my white socks on
And my blonde hair long
You like my pin-up bodice and the solace
That comes with the midnight air
And my icy stare
It's the clearest when it's me and him alone
He stops, he talks about all the ways he used to about all ways he used to 
Dinerettes and soda pops for our trip across the USA
We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in the Pontiac from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Gonna party like it's 1949

In his one line plea, in his dull edged knife
He asking for money money yeah money hunny
He asking for money money well alright
Well alright
Well alright
Well alrightPretty baby, if you don’t like the way that I touch you
Then I won’t touch you no more, yeah
Pretty baby if you don’t like the way that I love you
Then throw my love on the floor
My mean daddy, my bad baby
Don’t you want me?
I don’t believe you when you say
You want to leave
Darling, honey, if you don’t think that you're gonna want me
Then, honey, let me know
Listen, honey, I don’t wanna keep thinking you love me
Just to find out you don’t
Aren't you gonna miss me?
Honey, I’ll miss you
I just wanna kiss you, tonight
Pretty baby, if you don’t like the way that I hold you
Then, honey, let me go
Pretty baby, if you don’t like the way that I told you

My love
Knowing you are hurt inside
I think of all your happy times
Oh, my
When I ask what I can do
You say remember me the way I was six months ago, oh
I could do so much more for you, y'know
I could make you well if you just asked me to
Oh

Lord, watch over my love
I'll do anything
For you or for him
Or whoever else needs some help out there
I swear, I swear
Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
Always
Think of you on quiet nights
At traffic lights and
Every highway and
I get a little scared sometimes when
Everyone I meet I find has
A friend
Lord, watch over my love
Lord, watch over my love
My loveTake off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't us
Plus you're having too much fun
You're not in a rush
But it's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
​I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool losing all my power
It's funny how my life just stopped and shifted from meeting you as a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool trying to avoid danger
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight
But it's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
​Now I'm like a wild caged animal, sitting by the swimming pool losing all my power
It's funny how life can change or be shaped passing by a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool trying to avoid danger
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
It's funny how some things just change in a day, or even in an hour
​I'm like a wild caged animal, sitting by the swimming pool losing all my power
It's funny how life can change or be shaped passing by a stranger
Now I'm like a wild caged animal, lying by the swimming pool trying to avoid danger
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
But my lust for life
Lust for life
Keeps me alive
Ooh
Ahh
AhhDo you think I'm crazy
For considering aviation?
I'm a fan of flying
Why not do it for the nation?
Cause I have nothing else to do
This summer but commit it to you
Have a big degree in philosophy
But I don't know what I want to be
So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation
Do you think I'm crazy
Cause I'm up and leaving, baby?
Well, I ain't got nobody
And I ain't got no money, baby, yeah
I feel high as I might tonight
So lean back and enjoy the ride
And the weather is clear, yeah, nobody is near
The future is not here
So I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
Going into aviation
I'm going into aviation
Do you think I'm crazy
Cause I'm going to Pensacola?
Where nobody knows me
Where someone could just start over
I'll be all right in a month or two
Cause it's warm there in the winter, too
Think New York is great, I really like the state
But it's time to be on my way
I'm going into aviation, yeah, mom
I'm going into aviation, yeah, dad
I'm gonna take a vacation, yeah, man
Fly fighter jets all over the nation
Fly fighter jets all over the nationI'm the other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
You you, la-la-lie
You you, la-la-lie
Who else knows you're not a stand up guy?
Trouble in paradise, they can see it in your eyes
Living double lives, yeah your living double lives
He says he loves me, I don't believe him
If I'm so angry, why don't I leave him?
But he knows that I, I really need him
I'm tired of being, tired of being
The other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Chase that high, chase that high
Is there nothing that will satisfy?
There's trouble inside your mind, and you're desperate for the fire
Addicted to surprise, addicted to the lies
He says he wants me, why can't I see him?
Only at late nights, not on the weekend
I know his tough life, I know his girlfriend
I'm tired of hearing, hearing he's leaving
That other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
At the supermarket, waiting in line
Hair done, nails on, gold design
She walks up and whispered from behind
"Everyone knows your little secret"
I'm the other woman
Everyone's bridesmaid, nobody's bride
Everyone's mistress, nobody's wife
But we knew when you moved that you were the troubled type
You the kinda girl who, you the kinda girls
That other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman
Other woman, other woman30 blocks to Fordham Road
That’s a bad neighborhood
Crack house on the corner
I know I shouldn’t do what it is I could
The stone Mary in the garden
She let me know she watching
She said I better get walking
I better walk away
I don’t know why it is that I wanna stay
I don’t know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I’m not gonna do what I hear me say
I’m just gonna walk, I’m gonna walk away
I catch a dollar in the wind and I
Buy a cup of coffee
There’s a place on Valentine
That still charge ninety cents
I keep on walking in the daytime
And in my eyes, it’s always nighttime
And I like it when it’s me at night
‘Cause that’s when all the stars come out
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
I don't know why it is that I wanna stay
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk away
It's the greatest, it's the greatest day
It's the greatest, it's the greatest day, oh
I'm not gonna do what I hear me say
I'm just gonna walk, I'm gonna walk awayWhat an unusual name, you said
What a spectacular redhead
You really seem like a prize to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are not delirious
Oh what you mean to me
And she said, how do you know me so well
After only one night?
How do I love you, tell me
With all of my might
I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
Always
There's something she doesn't know about
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive side all his own, oh my
She got her skeletons as well
Some secrets he know she'd never tell
People who keep her alone
And she said
"How did I know you so well, why am I not surprised?"
He said, "Baby, go to hell."
And that was the demise of their love
Don't ever pick up a man if you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you have a history of being a loving fool
So that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need
I do not know you so well
Not more than that one night
Do you still love me, oh tell me
With all of your might?
I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you, my loveCaught up in a blizzard yesterday
Ought to be alone, or so I say
I needed a change of scenery
She was really starting to annoy me
I went out shopping and planned to go to all them vintage stores
Then I got tired and ended up in some lame department store
And that's okay, cause I found a really cool belt and..
I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you
I have a commitment Friday night
First I say my prayer then I'm alright
I sit in my chair, you dim the light
When I look I stare with inner sight
I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like you
Met up with some friends for Thai food
I liked it but wasn't in the mood
Can't you see that I'm just feeling blue?
What I do has got nothing to do with you
I feel like I'm in high school again
Never knew how much I missed until then
And I'm happy for this day
No matter what you say
I don't have to be sad like youLittle bits and pieces fall into the corners
Box of broken laces, lined up in an order
I'll do what you tell me, we can have it your way
I'll tell you the future, you tell me your story
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
I'm going out with a bang
Smiles from a stranger, seem to change your day when
You were just about to go and throw your towel in
Lately I've been thinking about making changes
It's been on my mind for some time and I'm anxious
Scowling like the sunshine, set on Sarasota
Happy like a twister over Oklahoma
Clear as Penny Mason lying in a coma
This is how I feel when all my hurt is over
Meet me in the morning, wrap your arms around me
Tell me that it's over, now that you have found me
Walk me to the river, see the willow bowing
Carry me into the water, now we're drowning
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going out with a bang
We're going to go home againYou have this way of making me
Say the opposite of everything I mean
I kiss you, I hug you
But I could not feel less connected from you
I know I wanted
All this in the beginning, I really tried
I know I caught you
At a not-so-happy time of your life
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride
I don’t quite fit the part of
She who loses everything and falls into insanity
The sun beams mean nothing
If you can’t find the light shining in one thing
It’s fine if you’re hateful
As long as all-in-all you remain grateful
It made me nervous to know you didn't like me
I really tried
The way I’m feeling in this moment
It can’t last my whole life
My dreams are bigger than your junky prideHiya honey
What ya doin'?
I been hula-hoopin' waiting for you, aah
Whoa haters, fakers, mass-manipulators
Don't know what you're tryin' to prove
I'm the New York City queen queen
You should hear me sing sing
Baby I'm the real thing, check one two
Stop looking at my train-wreck life and start
Listening to the way I sing the blues
You know, I know what they say about me
I know that they think I'm danger
So what if it makes me happy, happy, happy?
It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot
Hiya honey
How's it goin'?
Saw you skipping up on TV looking blue aah
You're shakin', makin' music and you're famous
Deep down you're the same girl I knew
She said, I know what they say about you
I know that they think you're crazy
I know that they are mistaken, baby, baby
It doesn't really matter what they say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Baby you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hot
Singing for the gangsters
Chasin' all that paper
Living life so dangerously
And there's nothing for my anger
Money is my savior
I can be whatever I think
It's like heaven, heaven
Living on the edge never knowing where I'm going to be
And I am dreading, never settling down
That's when dying is beginning to please
It doesn't really matter what you say
Cause I ain't gonna quit 'til the day I die
I'll be taking drugs, doing shots, making out in parking lots
With any little boy I spot
Honey you can't stop me, stop me, now
When I'm hot, I'm hotHey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?
It's strange the way we met
A desert road and then
My car had stopped and you pulled off
On your black motorcycle
You rode me to the bar
We danced all night under
The Christmas lights and the dark black night
With the lightning and the thunder
Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?
You took me to the edge
Of town, that's where you slept
You liked it best when no one else
Could find you or could bother
You poured us mint juleps
And kissed me the lips
You held me tight in the TV light
And you said you never loved her
You have a dark heart, like mine
Things that you've seen in dark time
Let me love you, let me touch you
Let me show you you'll be fine
Hey, stranger, my strange love
Would you be mine?
Am I what you're dreaming of?
Hey, stranger, my strange love
What makes you shine?
What makes you fall in love?I was born bad
But then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true
You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer or the silver pole
I did what I had to do
Femme fatale always on the run
Diamonds on my neck, whiskey on my tongue
Before I get back I gotta get drunk
So get over here pour me a cold one
Babe he can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage yeah
Sparkling in sequins say hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm flat out of luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
Now daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm kinda outta luck
Wrong, I know, killing someone
Gets a little easier after done it once
You know that I'm fine, you know that I'm young
So tell me you're mine, let's get it on
Babe he can see that I'm danger
Glamorous but I'm deranged, yeah
Dancing on top of the tables
I said it really nice, hey, can you be my saviour?
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm flat out of luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
Now daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm kinda outta luck
I love you, my little darling
You, my little darling
You, my little darling
You, my little darling
Dancing on top of the tables
Stronger, I wish I was able
Some  but I'm not capable
I gotta get you back, cause I gotta live 
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm flat out of luck
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kind of fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back but I'm kinda outta luckAnother day is over
Another day is done
Now I'm getting closer
To the rising sun
Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?
Another day is over
Another day is done
Another night I'm waiting
Waiting for the sun
Hey, there, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, man, how you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me?
Well, I don't know, little lady
You're awfully pretty
But I'm a nice man, I live a nice life
I have a nice house, I have a great wife
And I'm tired of making
Decisions without thinking
Another moon is shining
Another evening come
Another hour unwinding
Till the night is done
Hey, man, what you doing?
Would you like a little company?
Hey, there, how are you doing?
Would you like to sit next to me, next to me, next to me?Hey, , ah
Baby, come on
Are you back in Greenwich, droppin' acid?
Are you at the Archive, watchin' television?
Did you leave for Battery with your weed?
And your leather, lookin' like Ray Gillen?
Are you still the king of rock 'n' roll, babe?
Bet you miss hearin' me sing, calling me Lana
And did you take your run today
Along that West Side Highway?
Do you miss your baby mama?
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never come back to me?
Does it feel like yesterday to you, yet?
How quickly you forget how I made you smile
I remember everything
The diamond horseshoe, wedding ring, and the  
Blue hydrangea
Will my forever love never return to me?I had a man, he was sweet as pie
I met him as I waked right by him
He said, "Baby you so fine that when you walk
Even the stoplights stop talk about you
I saw you and I had to make you mine
‘Cause you ultimately the most fine
You know a man like me
Gotta have a woman that's killer
She's got a be killer, killer, killer, baby"
Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face
The way you talk, well, you make me smile
And I'm lookin' down ‘cause I'm kinda shy
You know you're so fine that when you talk
Even the roses get up to walk to you
You're crazy but I knew that at the time
I just cannot resist your golden grill
And your stupid pickup line
Fly body, dope in the face
Fly body, dope in the face
There's something about you when you say
“Come on, come on with me babe.”
And I don't know why but I know
Wherever you go, I'm gonna follow
Fly body, don’t mean a thing
Fly body, don’t mean a thing
Fly body, dope in the face
You're gonna be the, you’re gonna be the
You’re gonna be the death of me
You so fly, you so dope, babe
You so fly, you so dope, babe
Fly like a birdYou’re no good for me
Baby, you’re no good for me
You’re no good for me
But baby, I want you, I want you
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?
Baby, put on heart-shaped sunglasses
'Cause we gonna take a ride
I’m not gonna listen to what the past says
I’ve been waiting up all night
Take another drag, turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he’s gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it’s gonna be alright
Hit me my darling tonight
I don't know why, but I like it
Gotta get back to the wild
Give it up, give it up, live it up, live it up
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it now, low down and gritty?
Do you think we’ll be in love forever?
Do you think we’ll be in love?
Let’s take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we’re here for
Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed, it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye
Hit me and tell me you're mine
I don't know why, but I like it
Scary, my god, you're divine
Gimme them gimme them dope and diamonds
Diet Mountain Dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty

I said
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me
He’s a walk with the past
Love of the fast
Girls in the fast lane
His knuckles are brass
A heart like a horse
Love of the games, gold in his veins
Met him at the club
Singing my songs
He says, "Are you famous?"
I was once
A b-movie actress
Has been, but never was
He knows that it's love
He saw me on stage
Pointed my way
The look of desire, all on his face
I gave him the eye
And took my place
I could tell that he'd be mine by daytime
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can’t stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me
He's a man with a cast
Cane and a glass
Rim full of champagne, looking for class
A mind like a steel cage
Soul full of rage
Tactical nature so they call him insane
Met him at the club
And from that night on
He called me his princess, right on!
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it’s wrong but no one can save me
No one can save me
Oh, do, do, woah
When did I ever care
What they said about our love, my baby
My baby boo
Yo, our friends think it’s sad
Living so bad
I'm always crying
He’s always mad
Our life is a mess
Oh it's a shame
What did they see in each other?", they say
I met him at the club
And from that night on
Called me his princess, right on!
I'm his little ex-beauty queen
Never going back to where I've been
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can’t stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I can't stop myself 'cause I like them crazy
Hey you, what you doing?
I think you could probably be my baby, baby
I know that it's wrong but no one can save me
No one can save me
No one can save meWhen you play the bass, I get this feeling

Out on the way,  another babe
How do I do it?
When you play the bass, I get this feeling

I can’t apologize
For what my body wants
And what my heart decides
O-Ohh
‘Cause I’m so close to the real thing
Yeah, I’m so close to the real thing
I’m so close to the real thing
I could almost die
Say it isn’t over
Say it’s not goodnight
Maybe we could go somewhere
Start a pillow fight
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you’re a wild thing
Rockin' on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamite
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to blow
Take me out tonight
You’re dynamite
I’m ready to go
Touch me to ignite
Boy, you’re a wild thing
Rockin' on my heartstrings
I can see the stars collide
Baby, hold me tight
Oh, you’re dynamiteCan't put my finger on it
But I know I want it
I'm willing to try another way
That is, if I get by another day
Back and forth, I don't get anywhere
And I've been searching everywhere
And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight
Happy as the moon shine
Sifting in the night-time
Clichés find a home inside of him
When he enters all of the lights go dim
He's so sure he's got a tragic lifestyle
And I'm so sure I can make that man smile
And I'll try tonight
Just try tonight
A dark room in the night-time
Is how he spends all his time
If he could go on without your help
Then he would do it all by himself
But I don't think he got strength to muster
And he don't got a lot - lacklustre
He'll try tonight
To not get high
He'll try tonight
To not get high
But he will, he will, he will, yes he willYou are rollin' hard

Where did your love go babe before you turned criminal?
You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing god and get out of the way
So here we are, there we go and that's the way
That you gonna roll, that you gonna fight, gonna play
It doesn't really matter to me that you find your way
You've been gone for so long that you're a shell of yourself babe
You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing god and get out of the way
The sun once shined for you
I've changed my mind for you
Your golden day has turned to night
Your golden day has been denied
There's no more chances for you now, you never learn
You lit my fire baby, but I just got burned
You act like you're gonna live forever
What happened to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing god and get out of the way
You act like you're gonna live forever
What happen to no one does it better than you babe
You babe
You gotta quit playing god and get out of the wayI can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl
When you wake up to the day
And see the city, dark and gray
You can already see the curtain coming down
Sittin', open up your files
Right click just to see her smile
Transfer to your heart, and let the world go ’round
Shoo-wop shoo, baby
I can be your dream girl

When it all gets too much
Darlin', I'm soft to the touch
Hush, hush and stop your rushing
I can be your dream girl, baby
​iPhone ringing, boss is screaming
On the TV, news streaming

Close your eyes and change the station
Switch the pictures on your wavelength
Put me on your playlist, I’m your favorite song
Shoo-wop shoo, baby
I can be your dream girl
I can be your dream girl
When it all gets too much

City's sparkling, but you shut down
So you signal right and turn your engine off
Cars fly by you, stars beside you
Turn that radio inside you
Tune the station that's playing the one you love
Shoo-wop shoo, baby
I can be your dream girl

Inside your head
Tell me a story, daddyHe drive up in a summer sky, blue Bentley
Death reflecting in his eyes
Thought about all the women who loved me
I said, "oh no!"
He said, "get inside"
I said, "oh no!"
He said, "get inside"
I got into his summer sky, blue Bentley
Sun reflecting in my eyes
Thought about all the fun I had lately
I said, "Uh huh" I said "I want to drive"
I said, "Uh huh I want, I want to drive"
We drive, We drive
You say you wanna go swimming in my ring
It's green and shimmering
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
Like my lipstick, the color of dawn
We got out of his summer sky, blue Bentley
Death reflecting in the sky
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me
I said, "uh huh, I want, I want to die"
"Uh huh, I want, I want to die."You didn’t think about anyone else
You didn’t think about any of us when you left that place
You didn’t wanna go anywhere else
Nothing could satisfy you 'til you left
So you went away
Where'd you go?
Where are you now?
I ask about, so many of my friends
Oh, about their ends
What about us?
Are we just dust on the floor again?
I thought we were on the mend
You really put me in quite a position
You got me struggling as a musician with a song
You like to write about all of your problems
Put them in songs because you think it would solve them
But you’re wrong
Why did you go?
I guess I know
Maybe my question is, why must it come to this?
You talk about being strong, yeah
And how I want to be you and your melody
Trying to learn about something important
But you keep taking up space, you’re annoying
But I love you so
Yeah, you already know
They're trying to teach me about new ways of living
They’re trying to teach me about ways of forgiving
But you make it hard
You’re such a bad, bad boy
I love you anyway
No matter what they say
You are not a prude, but you are on the move
I care about how this turns out
It’s just more than I ever knew how to fight
I guess I won't
Tell me I have to, tell me I have to
I know you could
I said I know you could
Where are you now?

You can drink and drive, whatever you want to
And we'll get right down to it, me and you boo

In the spotlight we see Jim and Chuck
Saw that car from a mile away and it's slowin'

You can say what make you high
I see the way you be lying, be abused
I don't need anybody when I'm down
I don't really find it hard to get around
I'll find my own way back to town
Oh, don't you tell me how I need to be
That ain't up to anybody else but me
I don't care what you think
Breathing getting fast again
Now I'll start my worrying
When will I learn that there ain’t nothing I can do?
Jesus was a dying man
If he can't do it, no one can
When will you learn that we ain't nothing without you?
We don't need anybody when we're down
We don't really find it hard to get around

Yes, the good life lets you hide
All the sadness you feel
You won’t really fall in love
For you can’t take the chance
So be honest with yourself
Don’t try to fake romance
It’s the good life, to be free
And explore the unknown
Like the heartaches when you learn
You must face life alone
Please remember, I still want you
And in case you wonder why
Well, just wake up
Kiss the good life goodbyeI'll be home for Christmas

Lana Del Rey
Kacey MusgravesI'm doing alright, most of the time
In fact, yesterday, I was even doing real well and I
Think that I might claim you as mine
So that my head can rest and everybody can tell, and I
Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind
I make it a point to rest through my day
To close my eyes and visualize my troubles away and I
Think of you here and I close my eyes tight
Somehow the vision of you near makes me feel alright and I
Had a strange dream and I
Called you at night and I
Had to make known that I wasn't alright
And say that I had you on my mind
Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind
Had you on my mind
Had you on my mindEverytime you walk out on me
I regress back to the one that I can't see
He's someone I have never talked about
Cause I know that we'd both be dead if you found out
Everytime you tell me that I'm wrong
I just can't remember how to play along
There's something I have never told you
I'm not really from this world
There's something that I've been witholding
I'm not like every other girl
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
So if you begin to think that
My light might be supernatural
I'd have to say you're right
"You're right, mon cher, it is"
I came from a place that your mind can not even imagine
We say "Maha, mahaha, mahaha, maha"
And we sing
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
Loha, loha, maihi, maihi, yoha, yoho
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
You are the one in my dreams that I've waited for
I need your love babe
I need your loving
I need your love babe
I need your lovingWhat an unusual name, you said
What a spectacular redhead
You really seem like a prize to me
And you are so mysterious
When you are not delirious
Oh what you mean to me
And she said, how do you know me so well
After only one night?
How do I love you, tell me
With all of my might
I'm indebted to you
I'm indebted to you
Always
There's something she doesn't know about
A secret he doesn't show about
A sensitive side all his own, oh my
She got her skeletons as well
Some secrets he know she'd never tell
People who keep her alone
And she said
"How did I know you so well, why am I not surprised?"
He said, "Baby, go to hell."
And that was the demise of their love
Don't ever pick up a man if you don't think he'll understand
Don't ever trust yourself if you have a history of being a loving fool
So that's what she got when she married him
A lifetime promise to carry him
Him and his every second of need
I do not know you so well
Not more than that one night
Do you still love me, oh tell me
With all of your might?
I'm indebted to you

Been broken since I was born
Call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you did
You like your girls insane
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
You're a careless con and you're a crazy liar, but baby
I tried so hard to act nice like a lady
You taught me that it was good to be crazy
I'm tired of feeling like I'm fucking crazy

We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Pick me up
In a pickup truck
Roll it down
You got it going on
We could drive forever, my baby
We could leave it all and never look back
If you wanted heaven, baby
Sit back in my pink cadillac
Drive me in your car until the sky gets big
Swinging in the backyard, pull up in your fast car
Baby stopping at 7-Eleven
There in his white Pontiac Heaven
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast goin' 'bout 99
Even if you're gone, I'm gonna drive, drive, drive
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
Drive fast, I can almost taste it now
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits cause I just don't care
I'm driving fast, flash!
Everyone knows it

He drives a Chevy Malibu
Red racing cars, Sunset and Vine

Wilshire Boulevard if we choose
And we could cruise to the news

Wind in my hair, holding your hand, listen to a song
Left the canyon, drove to the club

But you're always close to me
You got a different story
It's the same damn thing
Got a long way, rest your feet
I know you can do anything
You were such a handsome boy
Don't you give up your glory
Why you want to hit them streets?
Didn't you never hear my story?
And it's fine to waste time
But you got a beautiful mind

Please don't go until I kiss you
And it's hard to grow up
But we all know it's tough
Yeah, you're always close to me
You have a different story
It's the same damn thing
You got a long way, c'mon and rest your feet
I know you can do anythingIn the beginning, there was the Sun, nothing but the Sun moving through the heavens. Covering the surfs of the Earth were seas, and the seas were turmoil. With civilization there came the surfer with his urge to conquer these moving walls of water.
Summertime,  and the livin's easy
Bradley's  on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C
Me,  me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And  dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
Oh God, miss you on my lips
It's  me, your little Venice bitch
On the stoop with the neighborhood kids
Callin' out, bang bang, kiss kiss
You're in the yard, I light the fire
And  as the summer fades away
Nothing gold can stay
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
Goddamn, man-child
You fucked me so good that I almost said ''I love you"
You're fun and you're wild
But you don't know the half of the shit that you put me through
Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can't change that, and I can't change your mood
The greatest journey is the journey of the mind since this is what determines the journey of life. Have you ever had the feeling that your mind is on a journey? A voyage of discovery? That sometimes it has to make long passages on dark, uncharted seas? And at other times it discovers bright islands of beauty or of truth. Islands it will know from this day forward, that it can always steer for and find in the storm while the gales of life blow themselves out and the enormous seas of misfortune, or pain, or sorrow, or doubt subside in the calm. Well, if you'll come, I'd like to take you with me on such a voyage of the mind.There's nobody here, just us together
Keepin' it hot like July forever
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
There's no way for us to come, wait
'Cause boy we're gold, boy we're gold
And I was like...
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're having too much fun
Too much fun tonight, yeah
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
'Cause we're the masters of our own fate
We're the captains of our own souls
So there's no need for us to hesitate
We're all alone, let's take control
And I was like...
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all your clothes
Take off, take off
Take off all of your clothes
They say only the good die young
That just ain't right
'Cause we're havin' too much fun
Too much fun tonight, yeah
And a lust for life
And a lust for life
We dance on the H of the Hollywood sign
'Til we run out of breath, gotta dance 'til we die
My boyfriend's back and he's cooler than ever
There's no more night, blue skies forever
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
And a lust for life, and a lust for life
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive
Keeps us alive, keeps us alive

        Well, dark clouds they'll subside for awhile
And sit down, I can make my friends smile
I have lost a lot but I'm sane, you know
And I'm calling you up just to say hello, so
Hi, my lovely, hi, my lovely
I am someone else
I did think I would live life alone
I was sure I was made out of stone
I have lost a lot but you helped me find
What was really real and some peace of mind
And I'm awfully thankful and I am so grateful
I need no one else
Will you think of me when I am gone?
Will you comfort me when I am wrong?
I have a lost a lot but I'm feeling fine cause I
Finally found out nothing's mine and I'm
Only human, I'm so human
I am nothing elseI'm America's Sweetheart
Trying to get away
You make it hard to leave
But it's easier for me to stay
I am so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the fighting, baby, we're
Not fooling anyone these days
I don't wanna stray
But boy, I'm so afraid
But it's not love that keeps me here
And it's not what you want to hear
So I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
And I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
Thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid
We were just teenagers when we fell in love
Driving in your fast car
Looking at the stars above
But it was not enough
You should never come between
A woman and her dream
And a man that never knew his place
There's no easy way
To come back from where you came
So, baby, now I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
'Cause I'm so afraid
I-I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
Nothing in your heart, boy
I thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid
And it's not love, it's just the fear
That you've put down for all these years
But I'm leaving now
I'm going
Back to Santa Monica
New York to L.A
Never coming back, boy
No matter what you do or say
I am done being afraid
Oh, I've had it up to here
With the panic and the fear
There's nothing in your heart
I thought that I could make you change
I'm so afraid
Oh, it's not love that keeps me here
It's not love that keeps me here
I'm done being afraid
I'm done being afraid
Oh, oh, oh:
Da da da da da da
Da da da da da da
Baby, da da da da da
Lately, but I see the sun
I know when, I know why
I see a sun
I know when, I know why
I'd like her to sing this that i wrote
Tasting like Pepsi Fire
Cinnamon lips just take me higher
Highs and goodbyes
Your lies and lullabies
National anthem within a ride
My head on your shoulder's side
Your voice is like Elvis's
When he gave Priscilla kisses
Really don't tell
Norman Fucking Rockwell
Blond, red and brown
Take me downtown
Tapes and snippets rewind
Bitch you'rein my mind
Jacqueline, Marilyn and Kennedy
Playing ukelele, hawaiian half-californian baby
The bees and sweet acid velvet shotgun
Mullholland is where we'll be dancing with the sun
Your eyes are starry as the moon
Whisper : '' You're my disco in June ''It's never too late, to be who you wanna be
To say what you wanna say
And it's never too late, to leave if you wanna leave
Or stay if you wanna stay, baby
I got a feeling in my bones
Can't get you out of my veins
You can't escape my affection
Wrap you up in my daisy chains
Hip hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover love, babe, mhm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, mhm
It's never too late, to see what I wanna see
Instead of what's in front of me, yeah
And it's never too late, to be free if you wanna be
I can help you if you wanna be, babe
'Cause I got a feeling in my bones
Guess I got love on the brain
Giving into your affliction
Wrap you up in my daisy chains
Hip hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover love, babe, mhm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, mhm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Don't be a bummer
Don't be a bummer
'Cause I got a feeling in my bones
Guess I got love on the brain
Giving into your affliction
Wrap you up in my daisy chains
Hip hop in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover love, babe, mhm
High tops in the summer
Don't be a bummer, babe
Be my undercover lover, babe, mhmI top every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
There is no solution
Life is without resolution
You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight
I remember New Year's that your everything seemed right
We had not made plans and we just drove all the whole night
Let's all go find a friend
Don't stop until the end
You must ask yourself, am I really the one?
You can't be of help if you can't have any fun
I'm your one if you want me to be
Please leave me be
Who are you to say a soul won't live forever
Yeah, yeah
I top every mountain there's a hurdle in the sky
When at last you've found them you will understand as I
Each breath is sent from angels
These people, they are not strangers
You must ask yourself what you really want in life
You must trust in me when I tell you it's alright
It's alright tonight
It's alright tonight
